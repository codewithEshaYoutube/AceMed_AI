BIOLOGY AND SOME MAJOR FIELDS OF SPECIALIZATION
Biology is the study of living things. It is a branch of science and like other sciences it is a way of
understanding nature. Biologists deal with the living part of nature and with the non-living things
which afect the living things in any way. they strive to understand, explain, integrate and describe
the natural world of living things. The literal meaning of biology is the study of life.
It is very diicult to deine life. There are certain aspects of life that lie beyond the scope of the
science of biology like the answers to the questions : what is the meaning of life? Why should there
be life? These are the questions not usually taken up by Biologists and are left to philosophers and
theologians. Biologists mainly deal with the matters relating to how life works.
Life, for biologists, is a set of characteristics that distinguish living organisms from non-living
objects (including dead organisms). Living organisms are highly organized, complex entities; are
composed of one or more cells; contain genetic program of their characteristics; can acquire and
use energy; can carry out and control numerous chemical reactions; can grow in size; maintain a
fairly constant internal environment; produce ofspring similar to themselves; respond to changes
in their environment.
Any object prossessing all these characteristics simultaneously can be declared as a living thing
and in an object for biological studies.
The science of biology is a very wide based study. It includes every aspect of a living thing. Therefore,
volumes and volumes of information are available under this major head. It is but natural to divide
the science into quite a number of branches for our convenience of comprehending and studying
biology.

You are surely familiar, at this stage, with Ecology, Embryology, Physiology, Morphology (external
Morphology or Anatomy), Palaeontology, Histology, Evolution, Genetics, Zoogeography etc. These
are branches of biology which deal with environmental relations, development, functions, structure,
form and internal gross structure, fossil, tissues, ancestral history, heredity and distribution of
animals in nature, respectively. In addition to these branches there are a number of other branches
of biology such as: Molecular Biology, microbiology, Marine Biology, Environmental Biology,
Freshwater Biology, Parasitology, Human Biology, Social Biology, Biotechnology, etc.

LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION
Hundreds of chemical reactions are involved in maintaining life of even the simplest organism. In
view of this, it is something of surprise to ind that of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements,
only 16 are commonly used in forming the chemical compounds from which living organisms
are made. These 16 elements and a few others which occur in a particular organism are called
bioelements.
In the human body only six bio-elements account for 99%of the total mass.

Fig 1.1 Percentage composition of bioelements by mass of a human being
The fact that the same 16 chemical elements occur in all organisms, and the fact that their properties
difer from those in the non living world, shows that bioelements have special properties which
make them particularly appropriate as basis for life.
Biological organization is not simple. It has high degree of complexity because of which the living
organisms are able to carry out a number of processes (some very complicated) which distinguish
them from the non living things. A living thing has built-in regulatory mechanisms which interact
with the environment to sustain its structural and functional integrity.
A living thing is, therefore, composed of highly structured living substance or protoplasm. In order
to understand the various phenomena of life, biologists for their convenience, study the biological
organization at diferent levels starting from the very basic level of sub atomic and atomic particles
to the organism itself and beyond which the study of community, population and entire world are
included.
Biological organization can be divided into the following levels.
8

V: 1.1
Fig 1.2 . Levels of Organization

1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Atomic & Subatomic Levels
All living and nonliving matter is formed of simple units called atoms and sub atomic particles such
as protons, electrons & neutrons.
Molecular Level
In organisms elements usually do not occur in isolated forms. The atoms of diferent elements
combine with each other through ionic or covalent bonding to produce compounds. This stable form
is called a molecule. Hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous and Ca are the most common
atoms found in biological molecules. The diferent types of bonding arrangement permit biological
molecules to be constructed in great variety and complexity. These may be micromolecules with
low molecular weight like C02
, H2
0 etc. or macromolecules with high molecular weights e.g. starch,
proteins etc.
Biological world has two types of molecules: organic and inorganic. An organic molecule is any
molecule containing both carbon and hydrogen. Inorganic molecules do not include carbon and
hydrogen together in a molecule.
An organism is usually formed by enormous number of micro and macro molecules of hundreds
of diferent types. Some most important and abundant organic molecules in organisms are glucose,
amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol, nucleotides like ATP, ADP, AMP etc.

V: 1.1
Organelles & Cell
Diferent and enormous number of micromolecules and macromolecules arrange themselves in
a particular way to form cells and their organelles. In case of simple organisms like bacteria and
most protists, the entire organism consists of a single cell. In most fungi, plants and animals, the
organism may consist of up to trillions of cells.
Numerous sub-cellular structures like mitochondria, Golgi-complex, endoplasmic reticulum,
ribosomes etc have been studied for their structure and function. It has become clear that functions
of the cells are accomplished by these specialised structures comparable to the organs of the body.
These structures are called organelles.
The arrangement of the organelles speaks of the division of labour within the cell. The prokaryotes
have only a limited number and type of organelles in their cytoplasm. Eukaryotes are rich in number
and kinds of membranous organelles. A cell membrane is however present in all cells whether
prokoryotic or eukaryotic.
Tissue Level
In multicellular animals and plants, groups of similar cells are organized into loose sheets or bundles
performing similar functions; these are called tissues. Each tissue has a particular function in the
life of the organism e.g. muscle tissue, glandular tissue, xylem tissue, phloem tissue etc. They are
specialized for contraction (movement), secretion, conducting water and for translocation of sugar,
proteins etc.

Organ & System
Diferent tissues having related functions, assemble together in a structure to carry out its function
with great eiciency. Such structures are called organs and they are specialized to perform particular
functions. For example stomach which is an organ has a function of food digestion (protein part),
has a secretory epithelium which secretes the gastric juice, and a muscular tissue (smooth) for
contracting the walls of the stomach and mixing the food with the enzyme thoroughly and moving
the food to the posterior end. The formation of organs also has a selective value because this leads
to an eicient accomplishment of their functions both qualitatively and quantitatively. In animals

1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
organ formation is far more complex and deined. Organs are part of organ systems where total
functions involved in one process or phenomenon are carried out.
The organ level of organization is much less deinite in plants than it is in animals. At the most,
we might distinguish roots, stems, leaves and reproductive structures. Clear cut functions, the
distinguishing features, can be assigned to each of these structures. Roots are involved in anchoring
the plant, storage of food and procuring water and minerals. The shoot supports the entire plant
while the leaves are primary organs for food manufacture. Flowers or other reproductive structures
are involved in producing the next generation (reproduction).
The complexity of the organ systems of animals is associated with a far greater range of functions
and activities than is found in plants.
Individual (Whole Organism)
Various organs in plants and various organ systems in animals are assembled together to form an
individual - the whole organism. The whole organism has its individuality as far as its characteristics
are concerned. It is diferent from other members of the same species in certain respects. The
various functions, processes, activities of an organism are coordinated. In an animal all the systems
work in coordination with each other. For instance if a man is engaged in continuous and hard
exercise, not only his muscles are working but there is an increase in the rate of respiration and
heart beat to supply the muscles with increased oxygen and food which they need for continuous
exercise. In animals the coordination is achieved by means of nervous system and endocrine
system, whereas in plants only long term regulation of activities is brought about by hormones.
Organism works as a whole and it interacts and responds to the environmental changes as a whole.
Population
A population is a group of living organisms of the same species located in the same place at the
same time. Examples are the number of rats in a ield of rice, the number of students in your
biology class, or human population in a city.
Population is a higher level of biological organization than organism (whole) because here a group
of organisms of the same species is involved. This level of organization has its own attributes which
come into being by living together of a group of organisms of the same species.
Some of these attributes are gene frequency, gene low, age distribution, population density,
population pressure etc. All these are new parameters which have appeared due to population of
an organism. You will study them in detail in population ecology.
13
1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Community
Populations of diferent species (plants and animals) living in the same habitat form a community.
Communities are dynamic collections of organisms, in which one population may increase and
others may decrease due to luctuation in abiotic factors. Some communities are complex and
well interrelated, other communities may be simple. In a simple community any change can have
drastic and long lasting efects.
The foregoing account makes it clear that an organism can be studied at diferent levels of
organization. It can be studied at subatomic, atomic, molecular, macromolecular, organelle, cell,
tissue, organ and organ system level. We can also look at it as an individual, as a part of population
of similar individuals, as a part of a community that includes other populations and a part of
community of an ecosystem which includes abiotic factors as well as living organisms, Fig. 1.2.
The organisms, interaction can take many shapes. It may be predation, parasitism, commensalism,
mutualism and competition.
Living World in Space
Living world of today is enormous in size. It has been reproducing and evolving since the time
of its origin on this planet. Today almost all parts of the world abounds in living organisms. The
distribution of organisms in space can be studied through biomes.
A biome is a large regional community primarily determined by climate. It has been found that the
major type of plant determines the other kind of plants and animals. These biomes have, therefore,
been named after the type of major plants or major feature of the ecosystem. The major biomes of
the world you will study in the chapter of ecology.
LIVING WORLD IN TIME
Since the time of origin of life on this planet, various organisms were evolved and dominated
this planet during various periods of geological time chart. This has been found by the evidence
obtained from the discovery and study of fossils which allows biologists to place organisms in a
time sequence. As geological time passes and new layers of sediments are laid down, the older
organisms should be in deeper layer, provided the sequence of the layers has not been disturbed.
14
1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
In addition it is possible to date/age rocks by comparing the amounts of certain radioactive isotopes
they contain. The older sediment layers have less of these speciic radioactive isotopes than the
younger layers. A comparison of the layers gives an indication of the relative age of the fossils
found in the rocks. Therefore, the fossils found in the same layer must have been alive during the
same geological period.
You can have an idea about the temporal distribution of various forms of life both plants and
animals in the various geological periods ( ig.1.3).

Phyletic Lineage
When we look at the biodiversity (the number and variety of species in a place), we ind that there
are nearly 2,500,000 species of organisms, currently known to science. More than half of these
are insects (53.1%) and another 17.6 % are vascular plants. Animals other than insects are 19.9 %
(species) and 9.4 % are fungi, algae, protozoa, and various prokaryotes.
This list is far from being complete. Various careful estimates put the total number of species
between 5 and 30 millions. Out of these only 2.5 million species have been identiied so far.
The life today has come into existence through Phyletic lineages or evolving populations of the
organisms living in the remote past. Evolutionary change often produces new species and then
increases biodiversity. A phyletic lineage is an unbroken series of species arranged in ancestor to
descendant sequence with each later species having evolved from one that immediately proceded
it. If we had a complete record of the history of life on this planet, every lineage would extend
back in time to the common origin of all early life. We lack that record because many soft bodied
organisms of the past had not left their preserved record as fossils.
Biological Method
Science is a systematized knowledge. Like other sciences, biological sciences also have a set
methodology. It is based on experimental inquiry. It always begins with chance observation.
Observations are made with ive senses viz, vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch, depending
upon their functional ability. Observations can both be qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative
observations have accuracy over qualitative as in the former variables are measurable and are
recorded in terms of numbers. An observer organizes observations into data form and gives
a statement as per experience and background knowledge of the event. This statement is the
hypothesis, which is tentative explanation of observations.
At this stage you should look at the ways of devising hypothesis. There are two ways of formulating
hypothesis. A hypothesis can be the result of deductive reasoning or it can be the consequence of
inductive reasoning.
Deductive reasoning moves from the general to the speciic. It involves drawing speciic conclusion
from some general principle/assumptions. Deductive logic of “if ....... then” is frequently used to
frame testable hypothesis. For example, if we accept that all birds have wings (premise #1), and that
sparrows are birds (premise # 2), then we conclude that sparrows have wings. If all green plants
16
1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
require sunlight for photosynthesis, then any green plant when placed in dark would not synthesize
glucose, the end product of photosynthesis. The other way of reasoning used in the formulation
of hypothesis is inductive reasoning which is reasoning from the speciic to the general. It begins
with speciic observations, and leads to the formation of general principle. For instance, if we know
that sparrows have wings and are birds, and we know that eagle, parrot, hawk, crow are birds, then
we induce (draw conclusion) that all birds have wings. The science also, therefore, uses inductive
methods to generalize from speciic events.

In fact sometimes scientists also use other ways to form a hypothesis, which may include (1)
intuition or imagination (2) esthetic preference (3) religious or philosophical ideas (4) comparison
and analogy with other processes (5) discovery of one thing while looking for some other thing.
These ways can also sometimes form basis for scientiic hypothesis. Hypotheses as you already
know, are subjected to rigorous testing.
Repeated exposure of a hypothesis to possible falsiication increases scientist’s conidence in the
hypothesis when it is not falsiied. Any hypothesis that is tested again and again without ever being
falsiied is considered well supported and is generally accepted. This may be used as the basis for
formulating further hypothesis. So there is soon a series of hypotheses supported by the results of
many tests which is then called a theory. A good theory is predictive and has explanatory power.
One of the most important features of a good theory is that it may suggest new and diferent
hypotheses. A theory of this kind is called productive.

1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
However even in the case of productive theory the testing goes on. In fact many scientists take it as
a challenge and exert even greater eforts to disprove the theory. If a theory survives this skeptical
approach and continues to be supported by experimental evidence, it becomes a scientiic law. A
scientiic law is a uniform or constant fact of nature, it is virtually an irrefutable theory. Biology is
short in laws because of elusive nature of life.
Examples of biological laws are Hardy-Weinberg law and Mendel’s laws of inheritance. You will learn
about them in later chapters. You can see that laws are even more general than theories and aford
answers to even more complex questions, therefore there are relatively a few laws in biology.
BIOLOGY AND THE SERVICE OF MANKIND
The science of biology has been helping mankind in many ways in increasing food production; in
combating diseases and in protecting and conserving environment. Biological advances in the ield
of food and health have resulted in high standard of living.
Plant production has been tremendously increased by improving existing varieties and developing
new high-yield and disease - resistant varieties of plants and animals used as food.
Plant and animal breeders have developed, through selective breeding, using the principles of
genetics, new better varieties of wheat, rice, corn, chicken, cow and sheep. Poultry breeders have
developed broilers for getting quick and cheap white meat. Genes for disease resistance and other
desirable characters are introduced into plant, using the techniques of genetic engineering. Such
transgenic plants (plants having foreign DNA incorporated into their cells) can be propagated
by cloning (production of genetically identical copies of organisms/cells by asexual reproduction)
using special techniques such as tissue culture techniques etc. Plant pathogenic fungi and insect
pests of crops which weaken the plants and reduce the yield had traditionally been controlled
by using chemical fungicides and insecticides (pesticides). Use of these chemicals poses toxicity
problems for human beings as well as environmental pollution. Moreover, there are chances of
insects becoming resistant to the efect of these chemicals. Biological control (control by some
living organisms) eliminates all such hazards. In biological control, pests are destroyed by using
some living organisms that compete with or even eat them up. An aphid that attacks walnut tree is
being controlled biologically by a wasp that parasitizes this aphid.
18
1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Even some bacteria are being used as bio-pesticides. Efective control of a particular disastrous
disease, or all the common diseases of a plant can be achieved by using all relevant, appropriate
methods of disease control. Such an approach of disease control is called “integrated disease
management”.
Soil is a complex medium. It is almost impossible to conduct experiments on nutrient requirements
of plants by growing them in soil. Hydroponic culture technique is used to test whether a certain
nutrient is essential for plant or not. In this technique the plants are grown in aerated water to
which nutrient mineral salts have been added. Hydroponic farming, however, is yet not feasible.
Astronauts may use it for growing vegetables.
Diferent techniques of food preservation have been developed for protecting food from spoilage
and for its use and transport over long distance without damaging its quality. One of these is
pasteurization, developed by Louis Pasteur. It is being widely used for preservation of milk and
milk products.

Disease Control
There has been fantastic progress in the area of health and disease control. Three pronged actions
are usually taken against various diseases.
1. Preventive measures
2. Vaccination/Immunization
3. Drug treatment/Gene therapy
Preventive measures
The advances in biological sciences have provided us information about the causative agents of
the diseases and their mode of transmission. For instance the AIDS (Acquired Immune Deiciency
Syndrome) is caused by HIV (human immuno deiciency virus) and it spreads through free sexual
contact, through blood transfusion, by using contaminated syringes or surgical instruments etc.
Therefore, doctors advise us to take precautions on these fronts so that we do not contract the
disease, which is at present incurable. Similarly hepatitis is caused by H.virus which is spread
through blood transfusion by using contaminated syringes and surgical instruments etc. In this
case also doctors advise us to be careful and avoid the point of contact.
Vaccination / Immunization
Many diseases such as polio, whooping cough, measles, mumps etc can easily be controlled by
vaccination or “shots”.
19
1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Edward Jenner irst developed the technique of vaccination in 1796, cowpox pus is known as vacca
(from latin vacca=cow). From this word evolved the present term vaccination and vaccine. You will
learn more about vaccination in chapter 6.
Since then, inoculation or vaccination is carried out to make the people immune from viral or
bacterial epidemics or, for some diseases the individuals are vaccinated in their early life to make
them immune to those diseases.
It is claimed that small pox has been totally eliminated from the world by using this method.
Scientists are making continuous eforts to develop vaccine against other diseases. Even vaccine
against AIDS is being administered in humans on experimental basis.
Drug treatment / Gene therapy
If a person becomes sick with disease, he is subjected to the action of antibiotics which can kill
bacteria. The antibiotics are, however, useful in bacterial disease and that only when bacteria have
not developed resistance to antibiotics. In cancer, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are also
used. In radiotherapy, the cancerous part is exposed to short wave radiations from the radioactive
material repeatedly at regular intervals. In Pakistan there are several centres which are carrying
out radiotherapy to control cancer. Chemotherapy consists of administrating certain anticancer
chemicals to the patients at regular intervals. These chemicals may kill both cancerous and normal
cells.
Recently a new technique has been developed to repair defective genes. This consists of isolating
the normal gene and inserting it into the host through bone marrow cells. This is called gene
therapy.
Combating disease utilizing all methods as and when required and ensuring a participation of
community in this programme is known as integrated disease management. This requires
awareness of the community about the severity of the problem, its causes and its remedies. This
is a very efective programme for elimination and control of dangerous diseases from the human
society.
Besides its contribution to food production and health of man, biology has discovered a number of
means and developed technologies for the welfare of mankind as for example cloning, protection
and conservation of environment etc.
20
1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Cloning: Cloning is a technology for achieving eugenic aims. A clone is deined as a cell or individual
and all its asexually produced ofspring. All members of a clone are genetically identical except
when a mutation occurs.
Generally no normal animal reproduces naturally by cloning. Several insects and many plants do,
in some circumstances whereas few do so regularly.
In 1997 scientists in Scotland succeeded in cloning a sheep. Other mammalian species (mice and
cows) have since been cloned. In this procedure the nucleus from a fertilized egg is removed and
a nucleus from a cell of a fully developed individual is inserted in its place. The altered zygote is
then implanted in a suitable womb where it completes its development. The new individual formed
in this way is a genetically identical clone of the individual whose nucleus was used. Thus cloning
could make multiple copies of a desired genotype.
Another type of cloning is the division of a single egg or early embryo into one or more separate
embryos. This is the same process that normally creates identical twins. Ofspring from this type of
cloning are genetically identical but carry chromosomes from each of the two parents. This type of
cloning has already been used to produce genetically identical cattle and other farm animals.
Man is likely to adopt cloning techniques for commercial production of valuable animals of known
pedigree such as horses etc.
At some places scientists are making attempts to clone human embryo which they believe can
serve as transplant donor. There is a lot of controversy on this issue as to whether human cloning
should be attempted or not.
PROTECTION AND CONSERVATION OF ENVIRONMENT
Industrialization has helped mankind to raise the standard of living. It has at the same time
destroyed our environment. Tons of industrial waste, and eluents in solid, liquid or gas form are
being injected into the environment by the industries. These eluents frequently contain sizeable
amount of certain very toxic even carcinogenic materials. Heavy metals like lead from automobiles,
chromium from tanneries, are playing havoc to human health. Environmental pollution has reached
alarming level in some countries.
21
1. Introduction eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
This problem, therefore, needs to be addressed or else it would soon be out of control in which
case the biocomponents of the world ecosystem would sufer irreparable loss and this environment
would no longer support life on this planet.
Biology has helped mankind in attracting attention to this problem and the biologists are striving
to ind the solution to set this environment right wherever it has deteriorated: Biologists have
already asked for the treatment of industrial eluents to be made obligatory. Several ways of
bioremediation (removal or degradation of environmental pollutants or toxic materials by living
organisms) are also under investigation. For example algae have been found to reduce pollution of
heavy metals by bioabsorption.
Biologists are also working out the list of endangered species of plants and animals which if not
protected would soon be extinct. They have, therefore, stressed the needs for their protection.
The environmental pollution is a national problem in Pakistan. Our rivers, canals are highly polluted
with the mixing of city sewage and industrial wastes. The life in fresh water of Pakistan is towards
decline. Fish populations have been most adversely afected. We need to take protective measures
as early as possible. In cities, particularly the exhaust from automobiles is enormously adding lead
into the atmosphere. There is then a need for lead free petrol to reduce the pollution.

INTRODUCTION TO BIOCHEMISTRY
Biochemistry is a branch of Biology, which deals with the study of chemical components and
the chemical processes in living organisms. A basic knowledge of Biochemistry is essential
for understanding anatomy and physiology, because all of the structures of an organism have
biochemical organization. For example, photosynthesis, respiration, digestion, muscle contraction
can all be described in biochemical terms.
All living things are made of certain chemical compounds, which are generally classiied as organic
and inorganic. Most important organic compounds in living organisms are carbohydrates, proteins,
lipids and nucleic acids. Among inorganic substances are water, carbon dioxide, acids, bases, and
salts.
Typically an animal and a bacterial cell consists of chemicals as shown in the following table.

The survival of an organism depends upon its ability to take some chemicals from its environment
and use them to make chemicals of its living matter. For this reason, cells of every organism are
3
2. Biological Molecules eLearn.Punjab

constantly taking in new substances and changing them chemically in various ways i.e. building
new cellular materials and obtaining energy for their needs. Life of an organism depends upon the
ceaseless chemical activities in its cells. This chemical activity is maintained with a high degree of
organization. All the chemical reactions taking place within a cell are collectively called metabolism.
Metabolic processes are characterized as anabolism and catabolism. Those reactions in which
simpler substances are combined to form complex substances are called anabolic reactions.
Anabolic reactions need energy. Energy is released by the break down of complex molecules into
simpler ones, such reactions are called catabolic reactions. Anabolic and catabolic reactions go hand
in hand in the living cells. Complex molecules are broken down and the resulting smaller molecules
are reused to form new complex molecules. Interconversions of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids
that occur continuously in living cells are examples of co-ordinated catabolic and anabolic activities.

IMPORTANCE OF CARBON
Carbon is the basic element of organic compounds.
Due to its unique properties, carbon occupies the
central position in the skeleton of life.
Carbon is tetravalent. It can react with many other
known elements forming covalent bonds.
When a carbon atom combines with four
atoms or radicals, the four bonds are arranged
symmetrically in a tetrahedron, and result to give a
stable coniguration. The stability associated with the tetravalency of carbon atoms makes it a
favourable element for the synthesis of complicated cellular structures. Carbon atoms can also
combine mutually forming stable, branched or unbranched chains or rings. This ability of carbon
is responsible for the vast variety of organic compounds. C - C bonds form a skeleton of organic
molecules as shown in Fig. 2.1
Fig. 2.1. : Unbranched and branched chains, and ring structure form and by C-C bonds.
Covalent bonds result when two or more
atoms complete their electron shells by
sharing electrons. When an electron pair
is shared between two atoms, a single
covalent bond results. An example is the
bond between two hydrogen atoms to form
a hydrogen molecule. Covalent bond stores
large amount of energy.

Carbon combines commonly with H, O, N, P and S. Combinations with these and other elements
contribute to the large variety of organic compounds. Carbon and hydrogen bond (C-H bond) is the
potential source of chemical energy for cellular activities. Carbon-oxygen association in glycosidic
linkages provides stability to the complex carbohydrate molecules. Carbon combines with nitrogen
in amino acid linkages to form peptide bonds and forms proteins which are very important due to
their diversity in structure and functions.
Large organic molecules (macromolecules) such as cellulose, fats, proteins, etc. are generally
insoluble in water, hence they form structures of cells. They also serve as storage for smaller
molecules like glucose, which in turn are responsible for providing energy to the body.
Small molecules, such as glucose, amino acids, fatty acids etc. serve either as a source of energy,
or as subunits to build macromolecules. Some small molecules are so unstable that they are
immediately broken down to release energy e.g. ATP. Such substances serve as immediate source
of energy for cellular metabolism.

IMPORTANCE OF WATER
Water is the medium of life. It is the most abundant compound in all organisms. It varies from 65
to 89 percent in diferent organisms. Human tissues contain about 20 per cent water in bone cells
and 85 percent in brain cells. Almost all reactions of a cell occur in the presence of water. It also
takes part in many biochemical reactions such as hydrolysis of macromolecules. It is also used as a
raw material in photosynthesis.
Solvent properties
Due to its polarity, water is an excellent solvent for polar substances. Ionic substances when dissolved
in water, dissociate into positive and negative ions. Non-ionic substances having charged groups in
their molecules are dispersed in water. When in solution, ions and molecules move randomly and
are in a more favourable state to react with other molecules and ions. It is because of this property
of water that almost all reactions in cells occur in aqueous media. In cells all chemical reactions are
catalyzed by enzymes which work in aqueous environment. Nonpolar organic molecules, such as
fats, are insoluble in water and help to maintain membranes which make compartments in the cell.
Heat capacity
Water has great ability of absorbing heat with minimum of change in its own temperature. The
speciic heat capacity of water - the number of calories required to raise the temperature of 1g of
water from 15 to 16°C is 1.0. This is because much of the energy is used to break hydrogen bonds.
Water thus works as temperature stabilizer for organisms in the environment and hence protects
living material against sudden thermal changes.

Heat of vaporization
Water absorbs much heat as it changes from liquid to gas. Heat of vaporization is expressed as
calories absorbed per gram vaporized. The speciic heat of vaporization of water is 574 Kcal/kg,
which plays an important role in the regulation of heat produced by oxidation. It also provides
cooling efect to plants when water is transpired, or to animals when water is perspired. Evaporation
of only two ml out of one liter of water, lowers the temperature of the remaining 998 ml by 1°C.
Ionization of water
The water molecules ionize to form H+
 and OH-
 ions:
 H2
0 m H+
 + OHThis reaction is reversible but an equilibrium is maintained. At 25°C the concentration of each of
H+
 and OH-
 ions in pure water is about 10-7 mole/litre. The H+
 and OH-
 ions afect, and take part in
many of the reactions that occur in cells.
Protection
Water is efective lubricant that provides protection against damage resulting from friction. For
example, tears protect the surface of eye from the rubbing of eyelids, water also forms a luid
cushion around organs that helps to protect them from trauma.
CARBOHYDRATES
Carbohydrates occur abundantly in living organisms. They are found in all organisms and in almost
all parts of the cell. Cellulose of wood, cotton and paper, starches present in cereals, root tubers, cane
sugar and milk sugar are all examples of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates play both structural and
functional roles. Simple carbohydrates are the main source of energy in cells. Some carbohydrates
are the main constituents of cell walls in plants and micro-organisms.
The word carbohydrate literally means hydrated carbons. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen
and oxygen and the ratio of hydrogen and oxygen is the same as in water. Their general formula
is Cx
 (H2
0 )
y
 where(x) is the whole number from three to many thousands whereas y may be the
same or diferent whole number. Chemically, carbohydrates are deined as polyhydroxy aldehydes
or kentones, or complex substances which on hydrolysis yield polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone
subunits. (Hydrolysis involves the break down of large molecules into smaller ones utilizing water
molecules).

The sources of carbohydrates are green plants. These are the primary products of photosynthesis.
Other compounds of plants are produced from carbohydrates by various chemical changes.
Carbohydrates in cell combine with proteins and lipids and the resultant compounds are called
glycoproteins and glycolipids, respectively. Glycoproteins and glycolipids have structural role in
the extracellular matrix of animals and bacterial cell wall. Both these conjugated molecules are
components of biological membranes.
Classiication of Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are also called ‘saccharides’ (derived from Greek word ‘sakcharon’ meaning sugar) and
are classiied into three groups: (i) Monosaccharides (ii) Oligosaccharides, and (iii) Polysaccharides.
Monosaccharides: These are simple sugars. They are sweet in taste, are easily soluble in water,
and cannot be hydrolysed into simpler sugars. Chemically they are either polyhydroxy aldehydes or
ketones. All carbon atoms in a monosaccharide except one, have a hydroxyl group. The remaining
carbon atom is either a part of an aldehyde group or a keto group. The sugar with aldehyde group
is called aldo-sugar; and with the keto group as keto-sugar. These are indicated in the case of two
trioses sketched below (Fig. 2.2).
Fig. 2.2: Structure of glyceraldehyde, a 3C Sugar (C3H6O3
). The aldehyde form is glyceraldehyde, whereas ketonic form is dihydroxyacetone.

V: 1.1
In nature monosaccharides with 3 to 7 carbon atoms are found. They are called trioses (3C), tetroses
(4C), pentoses (5C), hexoses (6C), and heptoses (7C). They have general formula (CH2O)n. where n is
the whole number from three to seven thousands.
Two trioses mentioned above are, intermediates in respiration and photosynthesis. Tetroses are
rare in nature and occur in some bacteria. Pentoses and hexoses are most common. From the
biological point of view the most important hexose is glucose. It is an aldose sugar. Structure of
ribose and glucose is given below (Fig. 2.3).





 Fig. 2.3 Structure of Ribose and Glucose.
Most of the monosaccharides form a ring structure when in solution. For example ribose will form
a ive cornered ring known as ribofuranose, whereas glucose will form six cornered ring known as
glucopyranose ( Fig. 2.4).

 Fig. 2.4 Ribose and glucose form ring shaped structures.
In free state, glucose is present in all fruits, being abundant in grapes, igs, and dates. Our blood
normally contains 0.08% glucose. In combined form, it is found in many disaccharides and
polysaccharides. Starch, cellulose and glycogen yield glucose on complete hydrolysis. Glucose is
naturally produced in green plants which take carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil
to synthesize glucose.

As indicated in the equation, energy is consumed in this process which is provided by sunlight. This
is why the process is called Photosynthesis. It is noteworthy that for the synthesis of 10g of glucose
717.6 Kcal of solar energy is used. This energy is stored in the glucose molecules as chemical energy
and becomes available in all organisms when it is oxidized in the body.
Oligosaccharides: These are comparatively less sweet in taste, and less soluble in water.
On hydrolysis oligosaccharides yield from two to ten monosaccharides. The ones yielding two
monosaccharides are known as disaccharides, those yielding three are known as trisaccharides
and so on. The covalent bond between two monosaccharides is called glycosidic bond.

Physiologically important disaccharides are maltose, sucrose, and lactose (see Fig. 2.5). Most familiar
disaccharide is sucrose (cane sugar) which on hydrolysis yields glucose and fructose, both of which
are reducing sugars. Its molecular formula is C12H22O11. Its structural formula is given in Fig. 2.5.

Polysaccharides: Polysaccharides are the most complex and the most abundant carbohydrates
in nature. They are usually branched and tasteless. They are formed by several monosaccharide
units linked by glycosidic bonds (Fig. 216). Polysaccharides have high molecular weights and are
only sparingly soluble in water. Some biologically important polysaccharides are starch, glycogen,
cellulose, dextrins, agar, pectin, and chitin.
Starch: It is found in fruits, grains, seeds, and tubers. It is the main source of carbohydrates
for animals. On hydrolysis, it yields glucose molecules. Starches are of two types, amylose and
amylopectin. Amylose starches have unbranched chains of glucose and are soluble in hot water.
Amylopectin starches have branched chains and are insoluble in hot or cold water. Starches give
blue colour with iodine.

Glycogen: It is also called animal starch. It is the chief form of carbohydrate stored in animal
body. It is found abundantly in liver and muscles, though found in all animal cells. It is insoluble in
water, and gives red colour with iodine. It also yields glucose on hydrolysis.
Cellulose: It is the most abundant carbohydrate in nature. Cotton is the pure form of cellulose.
It is the main constituent of cell walls of plants and is highly insoluble in water. On hydrolysis it
also yields glucose molecules. It is not digested in the human digestive tract. In the herbivores, it
is digested because of micro-organisms (bacteria, yeasts, protozoa) in their digestive tract. These
micro-organisms secrete an enzyme called cellulase for its digestion. Cellulose gives no colour with
iodine.

LIPIDS
The lipids are a heterogenous group of compounds related to fatty acids. They are insoluble in water
but soluble in organic solvents such as ether, alcohol, chloroform and benzene. Lipids include fats,
oils, waxes, cholesterol, and related compounds.

Lipids as hydrophobic compounds, are components of cellular membranes. Lipids are also used to
store energy. Because of higher proportion of C-H bonds and very low proportion of oxygen, lipids
store double the amount of energy as compared to the same amount of any carbohydrate. Some
lipids provide insulation against atmospheric heat and cold and also act as water proof material.
Waxes, in the exoskeleton of insects, and cutin, an additional protective layer on the cuticle of
epidermis of some plant organs e.g. leaves, fruits, seeds etc., are some of the main examples.
Lipids have been classiied as acylglycerols, waxes, phospholipids, sphingolipids, glycolipids and
terpenoid lipids including carotenoids and steroids. The structure of some of these lipids is given
below.
Acylglycerols
Acylglycerols are composed of glycerol and fatty acids (Fig. 2.7). The most widely spread acyl glycerol
is triacyl glycerol, also called triglycerides or neutral lipids. Chemically, acylglycerols can be deined
as esters of fatty acids and alcohol. An ester is the compound produced as the result of a chemical
reaction of an alcohol with an acid and a water molecule is released as shown below:
 C2H5OH + HOOCCH3 8 C2H5OCOCH3
 + H2

 alcohol acetic acid an ester
As indicated by dotted squares, OH is released from alcohol and H from an acid.
H and OH combine and form a water molecule. Fatty acids are one of the most important components
of triglycerides.

Fatty acids contain even numbers ( 2-30) of carbon atoms in straight chain attached with hydrogen
and having an acidic group COOH (carboxylic group). They may contain no double bond (saturated
fatty acids) or up to 6 double bonds (unsaturated fatty acids). In animals the fatty acids are straight
chains (Fig. 2.8.), while in plants these may be branched or ringed. Solubility of fatty acids in organic
solvents and their melting points increase with increasing number of carbon atoms in chain. Palmitic
acid (C16) is much more soluble in organic solvent than butyric acid (C4
). The melting point of palmitic
acid is 63.1°C as against -8°C for butyric acid.
Fig. 2.8: Some fatty acids with carbon numbers 2-18 are shown. Oleic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid (note a double bond between
C9
 and C10). Other fatty acids are saturated.
Fats containing unsaturated fatty acids are usually liquid at room temperature and are said to be
oils. Fats containing saturated fatty acids are solids. Animal fats are solid at room temperature,
whereas most of the plant fats are liquids. Fats and oils are lighter than water and have a speciic
gravity of about 0.8. They are not crystalline but some can be crystallized under speciic conditions.
Waxes
Waxes are widespread as protective coatings on fruits and leaves. Some insects also secrete wax.
Chemically, waxes are mixtures of long chain alkanes (with odd number of carbons atoms ranging
from C25 to C35) and alcohols, ketones and esters of long chain fatty acids. Waxes protect plants from
water loss and abrasive damage. They also provide water barrier for insects, birds and animals
such as sheep.

Phospholipids
Phospholipids are derivatives of phosphatidic acid (Fig.2.9.), which are composed of glycerol,
fatty acids and phosphoric acid. Nitrogenous bases such as choline, ethanolamine and serine
are important components of phospholipids. They are widespread in bacteria, animal and plant
cells and are frequently associated with membranes. Phosphatidylcholine is one of the common
phospholipids.
Fig. 2.9.: Phosphatidic acid is composed of glycerol, 2 fatty acids (on Cl and C2), and a phosphoric acid on C3 of glycerol. In phospholipid
a nitrogenous base (e.g. choline) is attached to phosphoric acid in phosphatidic acid.
Terpenoids
Terpenoids are a very large and important group of compounds which are made up of simple
repeating units, isoprenoid units. This unit by condensation in diferent ways gives rise to compounds
such as rubber, carotenoids, steroids, terpenes etc. Lipids constitute major source of energy, and
play an important role in the structure of membranes of the cell and of organelles found in the cell.
They also provide insulation, mechanical protection and protection from water loss and abrasive
damage.
PROTEINS
Proteins are the most abundant organic compounds to be found in cells and comprise over 50% of
their total dry weight. They are present in all types of cells and in all parts of the cell.

Proteins perform many functions. They build many structures of the cell. All enzymes are proteins
and in this way they control the whole metabolism of the cell. As hormones, proteins regulate
metabolic processes. Some proteins (e.g. hemoglobin) work as carriers and transport speciic
substances such as oxygen, lipids, metal ions, etc. Some proteins called antibodies, defend the
body against pathogens. Blood clotting proteins prevent the loss of blood from the body after an
injury. Movement of organs and organisms, and movement of chromosomes during anaphase of
cell division, are caused by proteins.
Proteins are polymers of amino acids, the compounds containing carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and
hydrogen. The number of amino acids varies from a few to 3000 or even more in diferent proteins.
Amino acids: About 170 types of amino acids have
been found to occur in cells and tissues. Of these,
about 25 are constituents of proteins. Most of the
proteins are however, made of 20 types
of amino acids.
All the amino acids have an amino group (-NH2
) and a
carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to the same carbon
atom, also known as alpha carbon. They have the
general formula as: Animation 2.9: Amino Acid

R may be a hydrogen atom as in glycine, or CH3
 as in alanine, or any other group. So amino acids
mainly difer due to the type or nature of R group.
Amino acids are linked together to form polypeptides proteins. The amino group of one amino
acid may react with the carboxyl group of another releasing a molecule of water. For example,
glycine and alanine may combine as shown in Fig.2.10.
The linkage between the hydroxyl group of carboxyl group of one amino acid and the hydrogen of
amino group of another amino acid release H2
0 and C - N link, to form a bond called peptide bond.
The resultant compound glycylalanine, has two amino acid subunits and is a dipeptide. A dipeptide
has an amino group at one end and a carboxyl group at the other end of the molecule. So both
reactive parts are again available for further peptide bonds to produce tripeptides, tetrapeptides,
and pentapeptides etc, leading to polypeptide chains.
 Fig. 2.10 Peptide linkage - formation of peptide bond
STRUCTURE OF PROTEINS
Each protein has speciic properties which are determined by the number and the speciic sequence
of amino acids in a molecule, and upon the shape which the molecule assumes as the chain folds
into its inal, compact form. There are four levels of organization which are described below.
20
2. Biological Molecules eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Primary structure: The primary structure comprises the number and sequence of amino acids
in a protein molecule. F. Sanger was the irst scientist who determined the sequence of amino acids
in a protein molecule. After ten years of careful work, he concluded, that insulin is composed of 51
amino acids in two chains.
One of the chains had 21 amino acids and the other had 30 amino acids and they were held together
by disulphide bridges. Haemoglobin is composed of four chains, two alpha and two beta chains.
Each alpha chain contains 141 amino acids, while each beta chain contains 146 amino acids (Fig.
2.11). The size of a protein molecule is determined by the type of amino acids and the number of
amino acids comprising that particular protein molecule.
Fig. 2.11. Polypeptide chains in keratin (ibrous protein ) and in haemoglobin (globular protein) are held together to form respective
functional proteins.
Now we know that there are over 10,000 proteins in the human body which are composed of
unique and speciic arrangements of 20 types of amino acids. The sequence is determined by the
order of nucleotides in the DNA. The arrangement of amino acids in a protein molecule is highly
speciic for its proper functioning. If any amino acid is not in its normal place, the protein fails to
carry on its normal function. The best example is the sickle cell hemoglobin of human beings. In this
case only one amino acid in each beta chain out of the 574 amino acids do not occupy the normal
place in the proteins (in fact this particular amino acid is replaced by some other amino acid), and
the hemoglobin fails to carry any or suicient oxygen, hence leading to death of the patient.
21
2. Biological Molecules eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Secondary structure: The polypeptide chains in a protein molecule usually do not lie lat. They
usually coil into a helix, or into some other regular coniguration. One of the common secondary
structures is the a-helix. It involves a spiral formation of the basic polypeptide chain. The a-helix
is a very uniform geometric structure with 3.6 amino acids in each turn of the helix. The helical
structure is kept by the formation of hydrogen bonds among amino acid molecules in successive
turns of the spiral. b-pleated sheet is formed by folding back of the polypeptide.
Tertiary structure: Usually a polypeptide chain bends and folds upon itself forming a globular
shape. This is the proteins’ tertiary conformation. It is maintained by three types of bonds, namely
ionic, hydrogen, and disulide (-S-S-). For example, in aqueous environment the most stable tertiary
conformation is that in which hydrophobic amino acids are buried inside while the hydrophilic
amino acids are on the surface of the molecule.
Quaternary structure: In many highly complex proteins, polypeptide tertiary chains are
aggregated and held together by hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen and ionic bonds. This speciic
arrangement is the quaternary structure. Haemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein of red blood
cells, exhibits such a structure.

Classiication of proteins
Because of the complexity of structure and diversity in their function, it is very diicult to classify
proteins in a single well deined fashion. However, according to their structure, proteins are
classiied as follows:
Fibrous proteins: They consist of molecules having one or more polypeptide chains in the form
of ibrils. Secondary structure is most important in them. They are insoluble in aqueous media. They
are non-crystalline and are elastic in nature. They perform structural roles in cells and organisms.
Examples are silk iber (from silk worm, and spiders’ web) myosin (in muscle cells), ibrin (of blood
clot), and keratin (of nails and hair).
Globular proteins: These are spherical or ellipsoidal due to multiple folding of polypeptide
chains. Tertiary structure is most important in them. They are soluble in aqueous media such as salt
solution, solution of acids or bases, or aqueous alcohol. They can be crystallized. They disorganize
with changes in the physical and physiological environment. Examples are enzymes, antibodies,
hormones and hemoglobin.
NUCLEIC ACIDS (DNA AND RNA)
Nucleic acids were irst isolated in 1869 by F. Miescher from the nuclei of pus cells. Due to their
isolation from nuclei and their acidic nature, they were named nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are of
two types, deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA and ribonucleic acid or RNA. DNA occurs in chromosomes,
in the nuclei of the cells and in much lesser amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. RNA is
present in the nucleolus, in the ribosomes, in the cytosol and in smaller amounts in other parts of
the cell.
23
2. Biological Molecules eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
 Fig. 2.13. Structural formula of ATP (a nucleotide)
Nucleic acids are complex substances. They are polymers of units called nucleotides. DNA is made
up of deoxyribonucleotides, while RNA is composed of ribonucleotides. Each nucleotide is made
of three subunits, a 5-carbon monosaccharide (a pentose sugar), a nitrogen containing base, and
a phosphoric acid. Pentose sugar in ribonucleotide is ribose, while in deoxyribonucleotide it is
deoxyribose. Nitrogenous bases are of two types, single-ringed pyrimidines, and double-ringed
Purines. Pyrimidines are cytosine (abbreviated as C), thymine (abbreviated as T), and uracil
(abbreviated as U). Purines are adenine (abbreviated as A) and guanine (abbreviated as G). Phosphoric
acid (H3
PO4 ) has the ability to develop ester linkage with OH group of Pentose sugar. In a typical
nucleotide the nitrogenous base is attached to position 1 of pentose sugar, while phosphoric acid
is attached to carbon at position 5 of pentose sugar (Fig 2.13 ).

 Fig. 2.14 : Components of ATP, a nucleotide.
The compound formed by combination of a base and a pentose sugar is called nucleoside. A
nucleoside and a phosphoric acid combine to form a nucleotide. Each nucleotide of RNA contains
ribose sugar, whereas sugar in each nucleotide of DNA is deoxyribose (one oxygen removed from
OH group at carbon number 2). ATP is also an important nucleotide used as an energy currency by
the cell (Fig.2.14.)
DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)
DNA is the heredity material. It controls the properties and potential activities of a cell. It is made of four
kinds of nucleotides namely d-adenosine monophosphate (d-AMP), d-guanosine monophosphate
(d-GMP), d-cytidine monophosphate (d-CMP), and d-thymidine monophosphate (d-TMP). These
nucleotides are united with one another through phosphodiester linkages in a speciic sequence to
form long chains known as polynucleotide chains (Fig.2.15). Two nucleotides join together to form
dinucleotide whereas three join together to form trinucleotide. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide,
abbreviated as NAD, is an example of dinucleotide. It is an important coenzyme in several oxidationreduction reactions in the cell.

In 1951 Erwin Chargaf provided data about the ratios of diferent bases present in this molecule.
This data suggested that adenine and thymine are equal in ratio and so are guanine and cytosine
as shown below in Table 2.2.

Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin used the technique of X-ray difraction to determine the
structure of DNA. At the same time James D. Watson and Francis Crick built the scale model of DNA.
All the data thus obtained strongly suggested that DNA is made of two polynucleotide chains or
strands. The two strands are coiled round each other in the form of a double helix. Coiling of two
strands is opposite i.e. they are coiled antiparallel to each other. The two chains are held together
by weak bonds (hydrogen bonds). Adenine (A) is always opposite to thymine (T), and guanine (G)
and cytosine (C) are opposite to each other. There are two hydrogen bonds between A and T pair,
and three hydrogen bonds between G and C pair. The two strands are wound around each other
so that there are 10 base pairs in each turn of about 34 Angstrom units (one Angstrom = one
100-millionth of a centimeter) (Fig.2.15).

RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)
Like DNA, RNA is a polymer of ribonucleotides. The RNA molecules occur as single strand, which
may be folded back on itself, to give double helical characteristics. The nitrogenous bases form the
usual complementary pairing viz. cytosine (C) with guanine (G) and uracil (U) with adenine (A). RNA
is synthesized by DNA in a process known as transcription.
Types of RNA
Three main types of RNAs — messenger RNA (abbreviated as mRNA), transfer RNA (abbreviated as
tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (abbreviated as rRNA) are recognized. All these three types of RNAs are
synthesized from DNA in the nucleus and then are moved out in the cytoplasm to perform their
speciic functions.
Messenger RNA (mRNA): As the name indicates it takes the genetic message from the nucleus
to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm to form particular proteins. Messenger RNA carries the genetic
information from DNA to ribosomes, where amino acids are arranged according to the information
in mRNA to form speciic protein molecule. This type of RNA consists of a single strand of variable
length. Its length depends upon the size of the gene as well as the protein for which it is taking the
message. For example, for a protein molecule of 1,000 amino acids, mRNA will have the length of
3,000 nucleotides. mRNA is about 3 to 4% of the total RNA in the cell.
Haemophilus inluenzae is the irst microbe to have the genome completely sequenced and this was
published on July 28, 1995.
All the information for the structure and functioning of a cell is stored in DNA. For example in the
chromosome of the bacterium E.coli, each of the paired strand of DNA contains about 5 million
bases arranged in a particular linear order, the information in those bases is divided into units of
several hundred bases each. Each unit is a gene, a unit of biological inheritance. The E.coli genome
consists of 4,639,221 base pairs, which code for at least 4288 proteins.

Transfer RNA (tRNA): It comprises about 10 to 20% of the cellular RNA. Transfer RNA molecules
are small, each with a chain length of 75 to 90 nucleotides. It transfers amino acid molecules to the
site where peptide chains are being synthesized. There is one speciic tRNA for each amino acid.
So the cell will have at least 20 kinds of tRNA molecules. Transfer RNA picks up amino acids and
transfers them to ribosomes, where they are linked to each other to form proteins.
Ribosomal RNA (rRNA): It is the major portion of RNA in the cell, and may be up to 80% of the
total RNA. It is strongly associated with the ribosomal protein where 40 to 50% of it is present. It
acts as a machinery for the synthesis of proteins. On the surface of the ribosome the mRNA and
tRNA molecules interact to translate the information from genes into a speciic protein.

CONJUGATED MOLECULES
Two diferent molecules, belonging to diferent categories, usually combine together to form
conjugated molecules. Carbohydrates may combine with proteins to form glycoprotein or with lipids
to form glycolipids. Most of the cellullar secretions are glycoprotein in nature. Both glycoproteins
and glycolipids are integral structural components of plasma membranes. Lipoprotein formed by
combination of lipids and proteins are basic structural framework of all types of membranes in the
cells.
Nucleic acids have special ainity for basic proteins. They are combined together to form
nucleoproteins. The nucleohistones are present in chromosomes. These conjugated proteins
are not only of structural, but also are of functional signiicance. They play an important role in
regulation of gene expression.

Enzymes are the most important group of proteins which are biologically active. They tremendously
increase the eiciency of a biochemical reaction and are speciic for each type of reaction. Without
these enzymes the reaction would proceed at a very slow speed making life impossible.
Enzymes are composed of hundreds of amino acids joined together and coiled upon themselves
to form a globular structure. The catalytic activity is restricted to a small portion of the structure
known as the active site. The reactant called substrate is attached to the active site consisting of
only a few amino acids, while rest of the bulk of the amino acids maintains the globular structure
of the enzyme.
Some enzymes consist solely of proteins. Others also have a non-protein part known as a co-factor,
which is essential for the proper functioning of the enzymes. The cofactor usually acts as “bridge”
between the enzyme and its substrate, often it contributes directly to the chemical reactions which
bring about catalysis. Sometimes the co-factor provides a source of chemical energy, helping to
drive reactions which would otherwise be diicult or impossible. Some enzymes use metal ions as
co-factors like Mg2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ etc. The detachable co-factor is known as an activator if it is an
inorganic ion (Fig. 3.1).
If the non-protein part is covalently bonded, it is known as a prosthetic group. If it is loosely attached
to the protein part, it is known as coenzyme. It is closely related to vitamins, which represent the
essential raw materials from which coenzymes are made. Only small quantities of vitamins are

needed because, like enzymes, co-enzyme can be used again and again. An enzyme with its coenzyme,
or prosthetic group, removed is designated as apoenzyme. Adding the correct concentrated
coenzyme to the apoenzyme will restore enzyme activity. An activated enzyme consisting of
polypeptide chain and a cofactor is known as holoenzyme.
Many enzymes are simply dissolved in the cytoplasm. Other enzymes are tightly bound to certain
subcellular organelles. They are produced by living cells for use in or near the site of their production.
The enzymes important in photosynthesis are found in the chloroplasts and enzymes involved in
cellular respiration are found in the mitochondria. Some of the enzymes which are involved in the
synthesis of proteins are integral part of ribosomes.
CHARACTERISTICS OF ENZYMES
Enzymes, the biochemical catalysts possess the following important characteristics.
1. All enzymes are globular proteins.
2. They increase the rate of reaction without themselves being used up.
3. Their presence does not afect the nature or properties of end products.
4. Small amounts of an enzyme can accelerate chemical reactions.

5. They are very speciic in their action; a single enzyme
 catalyzes only a single chemical reaction or a group
 of related reactions.
6. They are sensitive to even a minor change in pH,
 temperature and substrate concentration.
7. Some enzymes require a co-factor for their proper
 functioning.
8. They lower the activation energy of the reactions.
MECHANISM OF ENZYME ACTION
(CATALYSIS)
An enzyme is a three dimensional globular protein that has speciic chemical composition due to
its component amino acids and a speciic shape. Every enzyme by virtue of its speciicity recognizes
and reacts with a special chemical substance called substrate. Any enzyme, therefore, reacts only
with its speciic substrate and transforms it into product(s). It is then released unaltered and thus
can be used again and again.

Some enzymes are potentially damaging
if they are manufactured in their active
form. For example, pepsin is a powerful
protein - digesting enzyme and is quite
capable of destroying cell’s internal
structure and thus is produced in
inactive pepsinogen form by the cell. It
is converted in its active form only in the
digestive tract where it is required to be
active.

In certain cases enzymes act in a series of chemical reactions in a particular order to complete
a metabolic pathway such as respiration or photosynthesis. The successive enzymes containing
these reactions are normally present together in a precise order of reaction such that substrate
molecules can be literally handed on from one enzyme to another forming a enzyme to enzyme
chain. In this way, the products from one step in pathway are transferred to the enzyme catalyzing
the next step.

An enzyme and its substrate react with each other through a deinite charge-bearing site of an
enzyme called active site. The charge and shape of the active site is formed by some amino acids
present in the polypeptide chain of the active site of the enzyme. These amino acids are brought
closer and are arranged in a speciic way by coiling and folding of the polypeptide chain within the
globular symmetry of the enzyme (Fig. 3.3).
The active site of the enzyme is made up of two deinite regions i.e the binding site and the catalytic
site. The binding site helps the enzyme in the recognition and binding of a proper substrate to
produce an ES complex. This reaction activates the catalytic site. Activated catalytic site catalyzes
the transformation of the substrate into product(s). Thus the enzyme after catalysis detaches itself
from the products unchanged. Enzyme requires aqueous medium for its activity.
Emil Fischer (1890) proposed a Lock and Key model to
visualize substrate and enzyme interaction. According
to this model, as one speciic key can open only a
speciic lock, in the same manner a speciic enzyme can
transform only one substrate into products(s).
According to Lock and Key Model the active site is a rigid structure. There is no modiication or
lexibility in the active site before, during or after the enzyme action and it is used only as a template.
Later studies did not support this model in all reactions.
Fig. 3.3 Diagrammatic representation of an enzyme-substrate reaction (Lock and Key
Model)
Most enzymes do not loat about in a kind
of cytoplasmic soup’ but are attached
to membrane systems inside the cell
in speciic and orderly arrangements.
Mitochondria and chloroplasts are good
examples of this.

On the basis of new evidences Koshland (1959) proposed its modiied form. This is known as Induce
Fit Model.
He argued that when a substrate combines with an enzyme, it induces changes in the enzyme
structure. The change in structure enables the enzyme to perform its catalytic activity more
efectively.
FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATE OF ENZYME ACTION
The functional speciicity of every enzyme is the consequence of its speciic chemistry and
coniguration. Any factor that can alter the chemistry and shape of an enzyme can afect its rate of
catalysis. Some of the important factors that can afect the rate of enzyme action are: concentration
of enzyme, concentration of substrate, temperature, and pH of the medium.
1. Enzyme Concentration
The rate of reaction depends directly on the amount of enzyme present at a speciic time at
unlimited substrate concentration. If the amount of enzyme is increased by two fold the reaction
rate is doubled.
By increasing the enzyme molecules an increase in the number of active sites takes place. More
active sites will convert the substrate molecules into product(s), in the given period of time. After a
certain limiting concentration, the rate of reaction will no longer depend upon this increase.
2. Substrate Concentration
At low concentration of substrate the reaction rate is directly proportional to the substrate available.
If the enzyme concentration is kept constant and the amount of substrate is increased, a point is
reached when a further increase in the substrate does not increase the rate of the reaction any
more (Fig.3.4). This is because at high substrate level all the active sites of the enzyme are occupied
and further increase in the substrate does not increase the reaction rate.
8
3. Enzymes eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
3. Temperature
The rate of enzyme controlled reaction may increase with increase in temperature but up to a
certain limit. All enzymes can work at their maximum rate at a speciic temperature called as
optimum temperature. For enzymes of human body 37°C is the optimum temperature (Fig.3.5).
Heat provides activation energy and therefore, chemical reactions are accelerated at high
temperatures. Heat also supplies kinetic energy to the reacting molecules, causing them to move
rapidly. Thus the reactants move more quickly and chances of their collision with each other are
increased. However, further increase in heat energy also increases the vibrations of atoms which
make up the enzyme molecule. If the vibrations become too violent, globular structure essential for
enzyme activity is lost and the enzyme is said to be denatured.

V: 1.1
4. pH Value
Every enzyme functions most efectively over a narrow range of pH known as the optimum pH as
shown in Table 4.1.
A slight change in pH can change the ionization of the amino acids at the active site. Moreover,
it may afect the ionization of the substrates. Under these changed conditions enzyme activity is
either retarded or blocked completely.
Extreme changes in pH cause the bonds in the enzyme to break, resulting in the enzyme denaturation.

Inhibitors
An inhibitor is a chemical substance which can react (in place of substrate) with the enzyme but
is not transformed into product(s) and thus blocks the active site temporarily or permanently, for
example poisons, like cyanide;, antibiotics, anti-metabolites and some drugs.
Inhibitors can be divided into two types: (i) Irreversible (ii) Reversible
Irreversible Inhibitors
They check the reaction rate by occupying the active sites or destroying the globular structure.
They occupy the active sites by forming covalent bonds or they may physically block the active sites.
Reversible Inhibitors
They form weak linkages with the enzyme. Their efect can be neutralized completely or partly by
an increase in the concentration of the substrate.
They are further divided into two major types: A. Competitive B. Non-competitive
A. Competitive Inhibitors
Because of the structural similarity with the substrate they may be selected by the binding sites,
but are not able to activate the catalytic sites. Thus product(s) are not formed (Fig.3.6).

B. Non-competitive Inhibitors
They form enzyme inhibitor complex at a point other than the active site. They alter the structure
of the enzyme in such a way that even if genuine substrate binds the active site, catalysis fails to
take place.

The cell can be deined as the structural and functional unit of life. It is the smallest unit that can
carry out all activities of life. Cells are building blocks of complex multicellular organisms.
EMERGENCE AND IMPLICATION OF CELL THEORY
Study of cell (cell biology) began with the discovery of cell by Robert Hooke (1665), who reported
his work in his famous publication Micrographia. He prepared and studied thin sections of cork (of
dead plant material) under his self-made compound microscope.
He observed that the cork is composed of minute honey comb like compartments which he termed
as Cells (Fig.4.1). According to Hooke, cell is an empty space bounded by thick walls. Very little
information was added to this idea in the following century. The work again started in the beginning
of 19th century.
Lorenz Oken (1805) a German scientist , believed that
“all living beings originate from or consist of vesicles or
cells”. Jean Baptist de-Lamarck (1809) expressed similar
idea and said “no body can have life if its constituent
parts are not cellular tissue or are not formed by
cellular tissue”.
In 1831 Robert Brown reported the presence of nucleus
in the cell. Due to this discovery Hooke’s idea about
the cell as an empty space was changed. It was later
established that cell is not an empty space. A German
zoologist Theodor Schwann (1839) and a German
botanist Schleiden (1838), working independently,
came out with a theory called the Cell Theory.
They found that the cell consisted of 3 basic parts, viz
nucleus, the luid (cytoplasm) surrounding the nucleus, and an outer thin covering or membrane
(plasma membrane). The cell wall, they said, was an additional structure, present only in plant
cell. Keeping in view this deinition of cell, the cells could be observed in plant as well as in animal;
according to cell theory, all living organisms are composed of cells and cell products.

The cell theory is one of the most fundamental generalizations in Biology. It has wide ranging efect
in all ields of biological sciences. After the cell theory was presented, many details of cell were
studied, as a result of which the cell theory was extended.
Rudolph Virchow (1855), a German physician, hypothesized that new cells were formed only
by the division of previously existing living cells (to put it in Virchow’s words : “omnis cellula e
cellula”). It was contrary to the idea of “abiogenesis” (living things arise spontaneously from nonliving things), one of the prevailing but controversial ideas about origin of life, at that time. Louis
Pasteur (1862), one of the greatest scientists of all times, supplied experimental proof for Virchow’s
hypothesis by demonstrating that microorganisms (bacteria) could be formed only from existing
bacteria. Original cell theory and Virchow’s hypothesis gave us the basis for working deinition of
living things: living things are chemical organizations composed of cells and capable of reproducing
themselves’. August Weismann (1880) said ‘all presently living cells have a common origin because
they have basic similarities in structure and molecules etc. It was shown that there are fundamental
similarities in the chemical composition, metabolic activities and structure, although they difer in
many respects. Cells are basically similar but extraordinarily versatile. Cell is not only the structural
but also the functional unit of living organisms. So cell theory is a very important unifying concept
The human naked eye can diferentiate between two points, which are at least 1.0 mm apart.
This is known as resolution of the eye. This resolution can be increased with the aid of lenses. In
a typical compound microscope the resolution is 2.0 nm, which is about 500X that of naked eye.
A compound microscope is a typical laboratory microscope with at least diferent magniication
powers. The typical ocular lenses could be 5X and 10X, but others also exist. Likewise diferent
types of objective lenses viz. 20X, 40X, 100X etc exist. The magniication power of microscope is
determined by multiplying X values of ocular lense and X value of objective lense. Therefore, a
microscope with 10X ocular lens and 40X objective lense will have (10X40 = 400X) 400X magnifying
power. The resolution will, however, remain the same, which is 500X that of the naked eye. The
source of illumination in such microscopes is visible light. In electron microscope the source
of illumination is a beam of electrons and the resolution of microscope ranges between 2-4
Angstrom, which make it 500X greater than that of the compound microscope and 250,000X
greater than that of the naked eye. This means that two points which are 2-4 Angstrom apart
can be diferentiated with the help of electron microscope. The revelation of complexity of
structure of various cellular organelles is closely linked with the development of microscopy
and improvement in the resolution power of the microscope.

The salient features of Cell Theory in its present form are:
(1) All organisms are composed of one or more cells.
(2) All cells arise from pre-existing cells.
(3) Cell is the basic structural as well as functional unit for all organisms.
Cell as a unit of structure and function
A cell is a unit of structure and function in living organisms. In multicellular organisms there is a
division of labour among cells. Diferent cells are specialized for diferent functions. The function
of the organism as a whole is the result of the sum of activities and interactions of diferent cells
and of diferent components of the cell. In animals e.g., muscle cells contract and relax, nerve
cells transmit impulses, gland cells secrete, red blood cells carry oxygen and some stomach cells
secrete gastric juice. Similarly in plants xylem cells conduct water and mineral salts from soil to
the aerial parts of the plant. Phloem cells translocate food, sclerenchymatous cells give support to
the plants, chlorenchymatous cells carry out photosynthesis, parenchymatous cells store surplus
food and meristematic cells produce new cells for growth and development of the plant. As they
perform diferent functions they show great variation in shape and size. Despite the structural and
functional diversity, the plant cells as well as animal cells have a common plan of organization.
STRUCTURE OF A GENERALIZED CELL
Structure of a cell can be studied under light microscope as well as electron microscope. The modem
technology enables us to isolate various components of cells including its organelles by a process
of cell fractionation and study their structure and function in detail. During cell fractionation the
tissues are homogenized or disrupted with special instruments and the various parts of the cells
are separated by density gradient centrifugation. This separation is achieved by spinning the
homogenized or disrupted cells in a special medium in a centrifuge at medium speed. The various
cellular parts separate out in diferent layers depending upon their size and weight, and density of
the medium. Some cellular components require very high speeds for separation from other parts
of the cells. This is achieved through ultracentrifugation.

animals and plants absence of cell wall. Cells of animals and plants are complex and have a
distinct nucleus (chromatin material is bounded by a membrane) and are called Eukaryotic. On the
other hand, the primitive type of cells, such as bacteria, lack a deinite nucleus and are said to be
Prokaryotic. In Prokaryotes the nuclear material is directly submerged in the cytoplasm and is not
separated from it by membranes.
The eukaryotic cells vary greatly in size. They could be as big as an Ostrich’s egg. Most of the cells
are microscopic and are not visible to the naked eye. Their size is measured in micrometer (nm).
One nm is 0.000,001 meter or 1x 10-6 of a metre.
The use of modern technology has made it possible to study the following components of the cell
in detail (Fig.4.2 and 4.3).

Plasma Membrane
Plasma membrane or cell membrane is the outer most boundary of the cell. However, in most plant
cells, it is covered by a cell wall. Cell membrane is chemically composed of lipids and proteins; 60
- 80% are proteins, while 20-40% are lipids. In addition there is a small quantity of carbohydrates.
Many biologists contributed to establish the structural organization of cell membrane. It was
proposed earlier that cell membrane is composed of lipid bilayer sandwiched between inner and
outer layers of protein (Fig.4.4). This, basic structure is called the unit membrane and is present in all
the cellular organelles. The modem technology has revealed that lipid bilayers are not sandwiched
between two protein layers.
The protein layers are not continuous and are not conined to the surface of the membrane but
are embedded in lipid layers in a mosaic manner (Fig.4.5). This discovery led to the proposal of
Fluid Mosaic Model. This model at present is the most accepted one. Cell membrane also contains
charged pores through which movement of materials takes place, both by active and passive
transport.
Fig: 4.4. Unit membrane

4. The Cell eLearn.Punjab

Fig. 4.5. Fluid Mosaic Model
Transport of materials is one of the vital roles it plays for the cell. It ofers a barrier between the
cell contents and their environment, allowing only selective substances to pass through it, thus it
is known as diferentially permeable or selectively permeable membrane. The substances which
are lipid soluble cross it more easily than others, therefore, it regulates the low of materials and
ions to maintain a deinite gradient. Many small gas molecules, water, glucose etc. being neutral can
easily cross while ions, being charged particles, have some diiculty in crossing. Many substances
which are not needed, constantly enter the cell by passive transport, others are taken up against
the concentration gradient (they move from the area of low concentration to the area of high
concentration). This uphill movement of materials requires energy and is termed as active transport.
The energy used for this movement is provided by ATP.
In many animal cells, the cell membrane helps to take in materials by infolding in the form of
vacuoles. This type of intake is termed as endocytosis which can be either phagocytosis (to engulf
10

solid particles) or pinocytosis (to take in liquid material). In neurons (nerve cells) the cell membrane
transmits nerve impulses from one part of the body to the other to keep coordination.
Cell Wall
The outer most boundary in most of the plant cells is cell wall. The cell wall of plant cell is diferent from
that of prokaryotes, both in structure and chemical composition. It is secreted by the protoplasm
of the cell. Its thickness varies in diferent cells of the plant. It is composed of three main layers:
primary wall, secondary wall and the middle lamella. The middle lamella is irst to be formed in
between the primary walls of the neighbouring cells. The primary wall is composed of cellulose
and some deposition of pectin and hemicelluloses. Cellulose molecules are arranged in a criss
cross arrangement (Fig.4.6). The primary wall is a true wall and develops in newly growing cells. The
secondary wall is formed on its inner surface and is comparatively thick and rigid. Chemically it is
composed of inorganic salts, silica, waxes, cutin lignin etc. Prokaryotic cell wall lacks cellulose; its
strengthening material is peptidoglycan or murein. Fungal cell wall contains chitin.
Fig.4.6. Secret of the strength of plant structure is revealed by electron microscope photographs of the cell walls. The cellulose ibers
are arranged in layers, with the ibres of each layer at right angle to those of other layers.
11
4. The Cell eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Cell wall is very important. It provides a deinite shape to the cell and keeps it rigid. It does not act
as a barrier to the materials passing through it.
Cytoplasm
The living contents of the eukaryotic cell are divided into nucleus and the cytoplasm, the two
collectively form protoplasm. Cytoplasm consists of an aqueous ground substance containing a
variety of cell organelles and other inclusions such as insoluble wastes and storage products. The
soluble part of the cytoplasm is called cytosol. It forms the ground substance of the cytoplasm.
Chemically it is about 90% water. It forms a solution containing all the fundamental molecules of
life. In the cytosol, small molecules and ions may form true solutions, and some large molecules
form colloidal solutions. Colloidal solution may be a sol (non-viscous) or a gel (viscous). Peripheral
parts of the cell are often like a gel.
The most important function of the cytoplasm is to act as a store house of vital chemicals. It is also
a site for certain metabolic processes such as glycolysis.
In living cells the cytoplasm contains several cell organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum,
mitochondria, Golgi complex, nucleus, plastids, ribosomes, lysosomes and centriole. The free
loating cell organelles e.g. mitochondria move about in cytoplasm due to cytoplasmic streaming
movements. This is an active mass movement of cytoplasm.

Endoplasmic Reticulum
Under an electron microscope a network of channels is seen extending throughout the cytoplasm.
These channels are often continuous with plasma membrane and also appear to be in contact
with the nuclear membrane. This entire system of channels is the Endoplasmic Reticulum. These
membranes vary widely in appearance from cell to cell. The material present in these channels is
separated from the cytoplasmic materials by the spherical or tubular membranes, called cisternae.
There are two morphological forms of endoplasmic reticulum; a rough form with attached
ribosomes and a smooth form without ribosomes. The rough surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
is involved in the synthesis of proteins.
After synthesis the proteins are either
stored in the cytoplasm or exported
out of the cell through these channels.
The smooth surfaced endoplasmic
reticulum (SER) helps in metabolism
of a number of diferent types of
molecules particularly lipids. They also
help to detoxify the harmful drugs.
In some cells SER is responsible for
transmission of impulses, e.g. muscle
cells, nerve cells. In addition, SER also
plays an important role in the transport
of materials from one part of the cell to
the other. Endoplasmic reticulum also
provides mechanical support to the cell
so that its shape is maintained.

Fig. 4.7: Rough endoplasmic reticulum is marked by the presence of ribosomes attached to the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum.
Proteins synthesized on ribosomes are pushed into channels of endoplasmic reticulum, from where they are transported to Golgi
Apparatus, on their way out of the cell.
Ribosomes
Cell contains many tiny granular structures known as ribosomes. Palade (1955) was the irst person
to study them. Eukaryotic ribosomes are composed of an almost equal amount of RNA and protein,
hence they are ribonucleo-proteins particles. The RNA present in ribosome is called ribosomal
RNA. Ribosomes exist in two forms; either freely dispersed in cytoplasm or attached with RER as
tiny granules. Each eukaryotic ribosome consists of two sub-units. The larger subunit sediments
at 60S (S= Svedberg unit used in ultracentrifugation), while smaller subunit sediments at 40S. Two
subunits on attachment with each other form 80S particle. This attachment is controlled by the
presence of Mg2+ ions. The ribosomes are attached to messenger RNA through small ribosomal
subunit. A group of ribosomes attached to mRNA is known as polysome (Fig. 4.8).

Golgi Apparatus
Golgi apparatus was discovered by Golgi in 1898. This apparatus, which was found virtually in all
eukaryotic cells, consists of stacks of lattened, membrane bound sacs, called cisternae. These
cisternae together with associated vesicles are called Golgi complex. It is a complex system of
interconnected tubules around the central stacks. Cisternae stacks are continuously formed by
fusion of vesicles, which are probably derived by the budding of SER. Their outer convex surface is
the forming face, while the inner concave surface is the maturing face. The cisternae break up into
vesicles from the latter. The whole stack consists of a number of cisternae thought to be moving
from the outer to the inner face.

Apparatus has two ends, Forming Face and Maturation Face. Blebs from tips of SER fuse with Golgi Apparatus cisternae at Forming
Face, whereas secretory granules.
(transport vesicles) are pinched of at the Maturation Face of Golgi Apparatus. The arrows show the
direction of low of protein product systhesized on ribosomes. These proteins are converted into
glycoproteins in the Golgi Apparatus.
Golgi complex is concerned with cell secretions. Secretions are products formed within the cell on
ribosomes and then passed to the outside through endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi Apparatus. The
secretions are converted into inished product and are packed inside membrane, before export. For
example in mammals, the pancreas secretes granules containing enzymes that help in digestion.
The Golgi complex has a role in formation of these granules. The proteins or enzymes which have
to be transported out of the cell pass through the Golgi Apparatus. The most important function of
this apparatus is to modify the proteins and lipids by adding carbohydrates and converting them
into glycoproteins or glycolipids.

Lysosomes
Lysosomes are cytoplasmic organelles and are diferent from others due to their morphology.
These were isolated as a separate component for the irst time by De Duve (1949). Lysosomes (Lyso
= splitting; soma = body) are found in most eukaryotic cells. Any foreign object that gains entry into
the cell is immediately engulfed by the lysosome and is completely broken into simple digestible
pieces. The process is known as phagocytosis (eating process of a cell). They are most abundant in
those animal cells which exhibit phagocytic activity. They are bounded by a single membrane and
are simple sacs rich in acid phosphatase and several other hydrolytic enzymes. These enzymes are
synthesized on RER and are further processed in the Golgi apparatus. The processed enzymes are
budded of as Golgi vesicles and are called as primary lysosomes (Fig.4.11). Lysosomes contain
those enzymes which can digest the phagocytosed food particles.

Fig. 4.11: Lysosomes protect the cells from invading organisms or any other foreign object, (food) which are engulfed in the cell as

enzymes digest various.
components of the vacuole. Some times, under abnormal circumstances, e.g. starvation, or as a
normal physiological process the parts of the cell are engulfed by primary lysosomes and digested
to generate energy. The lysosomes which eat parts of their own cell are known as autophagosomes.
The digestive vacuoles and autophagosomes are also known as Secondary Lysosomes.
They are also involved in the autophagy (self eating). During this process some old, worn out parts
of cell, such as old mitochondria are digested. In this way, materials of cell may be recycled and cell
may be renewed. Their enzymes can also result in degeneration of cell, as may occur during some
developmental processes. Lysosomes also release enzymes for extra cellular digestion.
Several congenital diseases have been found to be due to accumulation within the cell of substances
such as glycogen or various glycolipids. These are also called storage diseases and are produced
by a mutation that efect one of the lysosomal enzymes involved in the catabolism of a certain
substance. For example, in glycogenosis type II disease, the liver and muscle appear illed with
glycogen within membrane bound organelles. In this disease, an enzyme that degrades glycogen to
glucose, is absent. About twenty such diseases are known these days, which are because of absence
of a particular enzyme. For example Tay-Sach’s disease is because of absence of an enzyme that is
involved in the catabolism of lipids. Accumulation of lipids in brain cells lead to mental retardation
and even death.

Peroxisome
De-Duve and coworkers isolated in 1965 particles from liver cells and other tissues which were
enriched with some oxidative enzymes, such as peroxidase, catalase, glycolic acid oxidase and some
other enzymes. The name peroxisome was applied because this organelle is speciically involved in
the formation and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the cell.
These are single membrane enclosed cytoplasmic organelles found both in animal and plant
cells. These are characterised by containing H2
02
 - producing oxidases and catalase. They are
approximately 0.5 nm in diameter. They have also been found in protozoa, yeast and many cell
types of higher plants.
Glyoxysomes
Plants contain an organelle, which in addition to glycolic acid oxidase and catalase also possess a
number of enzymes that are not found in animal cells. These organelles, called glyoxysomes are
most abundant in plant seedlings, which rely upon stored fatty acids to provide them with the
energy and material to begin the formation of a new plant. One of the primary activities in these
germinating seedlings is the conversion of stored fatty acids to carbohydrates. This is achieved
through a cycle, glyoxylate cycle, the enzymes of which are located in the glyoxysomes.
In plants, peroxisomes play important role in both catabolic and anabolic pathways. In seeds rich
in lipids such as castor bean and soyabeans, glyoxysomes are the sites for breakdown of fatty acids
to succinate.
This organelle is present only during a short period in the germination of the lipid-rich seed and is
absent in lipid-poor seed such as the pea.
Vacuoles
Although vacuoles are present both in animal and plant cells, they are particularly large and
abundant in plant cells often occupying a major portion of the cell volume and forcing the remaining
intracellular structures into a thin peripheral layer. These vacuoles are bounded by a single
22
4. The Cell eLearn.Punjab

membrane and are formed by the coalescence of smaller vacuoles during the plant’s growth and
development. Vacuoles serve to expand the plant cell without diluting its cytoplasm and also
function as sites for the storage of water and cell products or metabolic intermediates.
The plant vacuole is the major contributor to the turgor that provides support for the individual
plant cell and contributes to the rigidity of the leaves and younger parts of the plants.

Cytoskeleton
Cytosol contains cytoskeletal fabric formed of microtubules, microilaments and intermediate
ilaments. The main proteins that are present in cytoskeleton are tubulin (in microtubules),
actin, myosin, tropomyosin and others which are also found in muscles. Several cell organelles
are derived from special assemblies of microtubules, for examples cilia, lagella, basal bodies and
centrioles. The movement of cyclosis and amoeboid movements are because of microilaments,
whereas intermediate ilaments are involved in determination of cell shape and integration of
cellular compartments (Fig. 4.2).
Microtubules are long, unbranched, slender tubulin protein structures. One very important
function of mirotubules is their role in the assembly and disassembly of the spindle structure during
mitosis.
Microilaments are considerably more slender cylindres made up of contractile actin protein,
linked to the inner face of the plasma membrane. They are involved in internal cell motion.
Intermediate ilaments have diameter in between those of microtubules & microilaments. They
play role in the maintenance of cell shape.
Centriole
Animal cells, and cells of some microorganisms and lower
plants contain two centrioles located near the exterior
surface of the nucleus. In cross section each centriole
consists of a cylindrical array of nine microtubules.
However, each of the nine microtubules is further
composed of three tubules (Fig. 4.12). The two centrioles
are usually placed at right angle to each other. Just
before a cell divides, its centrioles duplicate and one pair
migrates to the opposite side of the nucleus. The spindle
then forms between them. They are absent in higher
plants. Centrioles play important role in the location of
furrowing during cell division, and in the formation of
cilia.

Mitochondria
Mitochondria are very important organelles of eukaryotic cells, because they are involved in the
manufacture and supply of energy to the cell. They are also known as powerhouses of the cell
(Fig. 4.13). Under compound microscope they appear to be vesicles, rods or ilaments. Under an
electron microscope, they show complex morphology. Although their number, shape and internal
structure vary widely, a mitochondrion is bound by two membranes, the outer membrane is
smooth, while the inner membrane forms infoldings into the inner chamber called mitochondrial
matrix. These infolds are called cristae. The mitochondrial membranes are similar in structure to
other cell membranes. Detailed studies have shown that mitochondria also contain DNA as well as
ribosomes.
The presence of ribosomes and DNA indicates that some proteins are synthesized in them. It is a
self replicating organelle.
The inner surface of cristae in the mitochondrial matrix has small knob like structures known as F1
particles (Fig. 4.13). Mitochondrial matrix contains in it a large number of enzymes, coenzymes and
organic and inorganic salts which help in several vital metabolic processes like Kreb’s cycle, aerobic
25
4. The Cell eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
respiration, fatty acid metabolism etc. As a result of these metabolic processes the energy extracted
from the organic food is transformed into energy rich compound ATP (adenosine triphosphate),
and the ATP then provides energy to the cell on demand. The size and number of mitochondria
varies and depends on the physiological activity of the cell.

lipoprotein membrane containing diferent enzymes as well as F1 Particles embedded in it. After a special processing the inner
mitochondrial membrane is ruptured and the F1 particles come out on the surface.

Mitochondria extract energy from diferent components of food and convert it in the form of ATP.
This energy is used for various cellular activities. The spent energy, which is in the form of ADP is
regenerated by the mitochondria into ATP. Mitochondria is therefore described as power house of
the cell.
Plastids
Membrane bound, mostly pigment containing bodies present in the cells are called Plastids. Plastidr
are present in plant cells only.
There are three main types of plastids.
1. Chloroplasts
In photosynthetic plant cells, there are membrane bound structures containing a green pigment,
called chloroplasts. The green pigment is an organic compound, chlorophyll, which helps the cell to
absorb light energy and utilize it to manufacture food. Chlorophyll molecule resembles the haem
group of haemoglobin, a protein used in the transport of oxygen. The main diference between
these two molecules is that chlorophyll has Mg++ while haem has Fe++ as the central atom.

V: 1.1
Chloroplasts vary in their shape and size with a diameter of about 4-6 nm. Under light microscope
they appear to be heterogeneous structures with small granules known as grana embedded in the
matrix. Under electron microscope, a chloroplast shows three main components, the envelope,
the stroma and the thylakoid. The envelope is formed by a double membrane, while stroma covers
most of the volume of the chloroplast. Stroma is a luid which surrounds the thylakoids. It contains
proteins, some ribosomes and a small circular DNA. It is in this part of the chloroplast where CO2
is ixed to manufacture sugars. Some proteins are also synthesized in this part. Thylakoids are the
lattened vesicles which arrange themselves to form grana and intergrana. A granum appears to be
a pile of thylakoids stacked on each other like coins. On an average, there are 50 or more thylakoids
piled to form one granum. On the layers of thylakoids chlorophyll molecules are arranged and that
is why granum appears to be green (Fig.4.14). Each granum is interconnected with others by the
non-green part called intergranum. Membranes of the grana are sites where sun light energy is
trapped and where ATP is formed. Chloroplasts are self-replicating organelles.
2. Chromoplasts
They impart colours to the plants other than green. They are present in the petals of the lower and
in the ripened fruit. They help in pollination and dispersal of seeds.
3. Leucoplasts
They are colourless. They are triangular, tubular or of some other shape. They are found in the
underground parts of the plant and store food.

NUCLEUS
Presence of cell nucleus was reported in 1831 by Robert Brown. Its early discovery was undoubtedly
due to its prominence in many cells, where it stands out as slightly darker than the surrounding
cytoplasm. It controls the life and activities of the cell. In animal cells, it generally occupies the
central space, while in the case of plant cells it is pushed towards periphery due to the presence
of a large vacuole. Nucleus may be irregular or spherical in shape. Generally, the cells have one
nucleus and are called mononucleate. On the other hand, the cells with two nuclei are binucleate
and with more than two as multinucleate.
Nucleus is only visible when the cell is in non-dividing stage. It contains chromatin network and
soluble sap called nucleoplasm. In dividing cells, the nucleus disappears and the chromatin material
in it is replaced by chromosomes. The heredity material is in the form of chromosomes, which
controls all the activities of the cell. DNA, RNA and proteins including enzymes form the chemical
composition of the nucleus. Nucleus consists of nuclear membrane, nucleoli, nucleoplasm and
chromosomes.
Nuclear Membrane
Nucleus is surrounded by a nuclear membrane which separates the nuclear material from the
cytoplasm. The nuclear membrane is actually a nuclear envelope composed of two membranes.
The outer membrane is at places continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum, while the inner
membrane encloses the nuclear content. The outer and the inner membranes are continuous at
certain points resulting in the formation of pores, the nuclear pores. The nuclear pores allow the
exchange of materials between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The number of nuclear pores is
highly variable. The undiferentiated cells (such as eggs) have numerous pores (about 30,000 per
nucleus), whereas diferentiated cells such as erythrbcytes have only 3 or 4 pores/nucleus. Each
pore has a deinite structure which controls the traic of substances passing through them (igs.
4.7, 4.10 and 4.16).
Nucleolus
It is a darkly stained body within the nucleus, and is without any membranous boundary to separate
it from the rest of the nuclear material. There may be one or more nucleoli in the nucleus. The
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized and stored in the nucleolus. It is composed of two regions,
the peripheral granular area composed of precursors of ribosomal subunits and the central ibrill

area consisting of large molecular weight RNA and rDNA. It is the nucleolus where ribosomes are
assembled and are then exported to the cytoplasm via nuclear pores.

Chromosomes
Nucleus is often deeply stained with basic dyes because of the chromatin material. During cell
division chromatin material is converted into darkly stained thread like structures known are
chromosomes. Under a compound microscope, chromosomes appear to be made of arms and
centromeres. Centromere is the place on the chromosome where spindle ibres are attached during
cell division. Each chromosome consists of two identical chromatids at the beginning of cell division
(chromatid is exact replica of the chromosome) which are held together at centromere (Fig.4.15).
A chromosome is composed of DNA and proteins. All the information necessary to control the
activities of the cell is located on the chromosomes in the form of genes, which are transferred
from one generation to the other. The number of chromosomes in all individuals of the same
species remains constant generation after generation. In man, each cell contains 46 chromosomes,
frog cell has 26 and chimpanzee has 48 chromosomes. There are 8 chromosoms in the fruit ly,
Drosophila melanogaster, 16 chromosomes in onion, 48 in potato, and 14 in garden pea. The number
of chromosomes in normal body cells is diploid (2n), whereas haploid chromosome number (n)
is present in germ cells, e.g human sperms and eggs have 23, while those of Drosophila have 4
chromosomes.

PROKARYOTIC AND EUKARYOTIC CELL
Biologists have divided cells into two types: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. The diferences between
these two types of cells are mainly based upon the structure of their nuclei. Eukaryotes have a
very well deined nucleus, in which nuclear material (chromosomes or DNA) is enclosed in double
nuclear membrane. In prokaryotic cells, however the genetic material (DNA) is without any nuclear
membrane covering and is directly submerged in the cytoplasm. Organisms possessing prokaryotic
cells are called Prokaryotes and those possessing eukaryotic cells are called Eukaryotes. Prokaryotes
include bacteria and blue green algae. Eukaryotes include all other unicellular or multicellular
organisms such as animals, plants, fungi and protista.
Diagrams of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are given in Fig 4.2, 4.3, and 4.17. Prokaryotic cells
generally lack many of the membrane bounded structures found in eukaryotic cells. For example,
mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, chloroplasts and Golgi apparatus are absent in prokaryotic
32
4. The Cell eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
cells. Since there is no nuclear membrane, a prokaryotic cell has no distinct nucleus and its DNA
molecule is directly suspended in cytoplasm. Prokaryotes have small sized ribosomes 70S compared
to eukaryotes 80S. In prokaryotes mitosis is missing and the cell divides by binary ission. Because
of their simpler structure, it was widely accepted for a long time that prokaryotic cells represent a
more primitive stage of evolution than eukaryotic cells. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of
the prokaryotic cell is its cell wall, composed of polysaccharide chains bound covalently to shorter
chains of amino acids forming peptidoglycan or murein. The entire cell wall is often regarded as a
single huge molecule or molecular complex called sacculus The cell wall of plants is generally made
up of cellulose and is diferently structured than that of a bacterium.

Over one and a half million species of animals and over a half million species of plants are known.
To deal with such a large collection of dissimilar forms, certainly we need some system by which
species can be classiied in a reasonable way. Many types of classiications are possible. We could ,
for example , classify lowering plants according to their colour, height, or any other character. This
type of classiication is not meaningful since it does not provide any information about the basic
diferences and similarities among diferent individuals.
All organisms are related to one another at some point in their evolutionary histories. However,
some organisms are more closely related than others. Sparrows are more closely related to pigeons
than either to the insects. Classiication is based on relationship amongst individuals, that is, similarity
in form or structure. Biologists have classiied all living things into groups showing similarities,
based upon homologies, comparative biochemistry, cytology and genetics. Large groups are divided
into smaller groups upto species level. “A species is a group of natural population which can
interbreed freely among themselves and produce fertile ofsprings, but are reproductively
isolated from all other such groups in nature”. However “interbreeding” cannot be used as
a criterion for species recognition among predominantly asexually reproducing organisms. Each
species possessed its own distinct structural, ecological and behavioral characteristics, hence
species are independent evolutionary units. Diferent species do not exchange genes between
them. Since long the living things are divided in two kingdoms: plants and animals. Next each
kingdom is divided into smaller groups called phyla (also divisions for plants, algae and fungi).
A phylum, in turn, is divided into classes, classes into orders, and an order into families. A family
contains related genera, and a genus is composed of one or more species. Species is the basic
unit of classiication. Conversely speaking, the organisms are grouped into larger, more inclusive
categories (taxa), each category is more general than the one below it and has emergent properties.
The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom form a hierarchy as described in the classiication
of corn.

Members of a lower category resemble one another more than do the members of a higher taxon.
NOMENCLATURE
From the earliest times plants and animals have been given common names by the people. Since
no system was used in choosing common names, in many cases, various regions had their own
names for the same plant or animal . Take ‘Onion’ for example; its common urdu name is ‘Piyaz’ but
in diferent regions of Pakistan it is also known as ‘ganda’ or ‘bassal’ or ‘vassal’. In diferent countries
it would have another set of names. Similarly ‘amaltas’, ‘argvad’, ‘gurmala’, ‘golden shower’, purging
cassia’ are common names for the same plant. Thus the same plant may have diferent names. In
some cases, a single name refers to several diferent plants or animals. What is ‘blue bell’? Dozen of
plants with bell shaped lowers are called ‘blue bells’. Similarly the word ‘black bird’ would mean a
crow as well as a raven.Common names have no scientiic basis. To a biologist, a ish is a vertebrate
animal with a backbone, ins and gills. But ‘silver ish’ is an insect, and a ‘cray ish’, ‘jelly ish’ and
‘starish’ do not it the biologist’s deinition of a ish.
Common names had long caused confusion. During the 18th century, Carlous Linnaeus (1707-1778),
a Swedish botanist, devised a system for naming and classifying all the organisms known to him.
His system is used today internationally. He discarded the common names of plants and gave
each one a scientiic name. He took the scientiic name from Latin word. Linnaeus publishes the
list of names of plants in 1753. The scientiic name of each plant had two parts. Usually, the name
referred to some characteristics of the organisms or the person who collected it. His system spread
rapidly and became so popular that he used it later on in naming animals and published his list in
1758. Many of his names are in use today.

Linnaeus’s system of giving each species a scientiic name comprising two words is known as
binomial nomenclature. The irst name refers to the genus (p1. genera) and is called generic name
and always begins with a capital letter. The speciic name follows the generic name and begins with
small letter. Scientiic name for onion is Allium cepa, for amaltas Cassia istula and for man Homo
sapiens. Botanical name for potato is Solanum tuberosum and for brinjal Solanum melangena. The
same generic name for potato and brinjal relects close relationship between theses two-species.
Every specie has only one scientiic name the world over. Initially the classiication was based on
the appearance or morphology of plants and animals but with advancement in the knowledge
of cytology, physiology, genetics and molecular biology the classiication of organism has been
modiied.
TWO TO FIVE KINGDOM CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS
Diferent classiication systems recognize two to six kingdoms. For centuries , the living organisms
have been classiied into two kingdoms, plants and animals. Plants can prepare their own food
from simple inorganic material and store energy (autotrophs), while animals can not synthesize
their own food from simple inorganic material and depend for their food either on autotrophs
or on decaying organic matter (heterotrophs). Bacteria were included in plants. Many biologists
found this system satisfactory, while others found it unworkable’ for many unicellular organisms
like Euglena that have both plant like (presence of chlorophyll) and animal like (lack of cell wall)
characters and also because it ignores the diferences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
In 1866, Ernst Hackel proposed a third kingdom protista to accommodate Euglena like organisms
and bacteria. In 1937, E-Chatton suggested diferentiating terms procariotique (from Greek pro,
meaning before, and karyon, meaning nucleus) used to describe bacteria and blue-green algae,
and the term eu-cariotique (from Greek eu, mean true) to describe animal and plant cells. Some
biologists also disagree about the classiication of fungi, such as bread mold, yeast and mushrooms,
which resemble plants in many ways but are not autotrophs. Fungi are special forms of heterotrophs
that obtain energy and structural material by breaking down (decomposing) and absorbing food
substances from the surroundings, and possess chitin as a major structural component in their cell
walls.
A relatively recent system of classiication, the ive kingdom system, was proposed by Robert
Whittaker (1969). This system of classiication shown in Fig 5.1 is based on three diferent levels of
cellular organization associated with three principal modes of nutrition- photosynthesis,
5
5. Variety of Life eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
absorption and ingestion. The ive kingdoms proposed (i) the prokaryotic unicellular organisms
(Monera) such as bacteria, (ii) the eukaryotic predominantly unicellular organisms (Protista) such
as Euglena and Amoeba, (iii) the eukaryotic multicellular autotrophs (Plantae), (iv) the eukaryotic
multicellular reducers (Fungi) for example mushrooms and (v) the eukaryotic multicellular
consumers (Animalia). Plants are autotrophic in nutritional mode, making their own food by
photosynthesis such as mosses, ferns, lowering plants. Fungi are heterotrophic organisms that
are absorptive in their nutritional mode. Most fungi are decomposers that live on organic material,
secrete digestive enzymes and absorb small organic molecules which are produced by digestion.
Animals live mostly by ingesting food and digesting it within specialized cavities. They lack cellulose
and show movements for example birds and reptiles. In ive kingdom classiication, all eukaryotes
that did not it the deinition of plants, fungi or animalia were included in Protista. Most Protists are
unicellular forms, but this kingdom also includes relatively simple multicellular organisms that are
believed to be direct descendants of unicellular protists.

VIRUSES
About a century ago at the time of Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and Robert Koch (1843-1910), the
word “virus” was generally referred to as a poison associated with disease and death. The present
notion of virus is entirely diferent. Now viruses are recognized as particles of nucleic acid often with
a protein coat. They replicate in living cells and cause many diseases such as inluenza, hepatitis,
small pox and AIDS. In this section the focus is on the properiies of viruses and life cycle of bacterial
viruses, also known as bacteriophages. Some diseases caused by viruses shall also be discussed in
this section. The branch which deals with the study of viruses is known as virology.
The word virus is derived from Latin word venome meaning poisonous luid. It can be deined as
non cellular infectious entities which contain either RNA or DNA, normally encased in proteinaceous
coat, and reproduce only in living cells. Viruses utilize the biosynthetic machinery of the host for its
own synthesis and then transfer themselves eiciently to other cells.
Some viral diseases have been known for centuries. In fact, the irst infectious disease against
which efective method of prevention was developed was a viral disease. In 1796, Edward Jenner
irst vaccinated an 8 years old boy with material removed from cowpox lesion on the hand of
milkmaid. After six weeks the boy was inoculated with pus from a small pox victim, but he did
not develop the disease. Later, Jenner used material for vaccination from cowpox lesions and
successfully vaccinated 23 persons. As the material he used was obtained from cow (latin vacca),
latter the term vaccination was used by Louis Pasteur for inoculation against disease.
In 1884, one of Pasteur’s associates, Charles Chamberland, found that bacteria can not pass through
porcelain ilters, while agent responsible for rabies (a disease which is transferred to human by bites
of rabid dogs, foxes, cats, bats and other animals) can pass through these ilters. As in those days
the word virus was loosely used to describe any toxic substance that caused disease, those unseen
ilterable agents of disease were described as ilterable viruses. In 1892, Ivanowski discovered that
the agent which caused tobacco mosaic disease was ilterable. He obtained bacteria free iltrate
from ground up infected plants and placed it on healthy leaves of tobacco. He observed that iltrate
produced the disease in healthy plants. After that, presence of similar ilter-passing, ultramicroscopic
agents was seen in the victims of many diseases, including foot and mouth disease (1898) and
yellow fever (1901).

The ilterable agents were irst puriied in 1935, when
Stanley was successful in crystallizing the tobacco mosaic
virus. Chemical analysis of these particles showed
that they contained only nucleic acid and protein. This
suggested that, unlike other forms, viruses are of simple
chemical composition.
Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, were
discovered independently by Twort in 1915 and
D’Herelle in 1917. Twort observed that bacterial
colonies sometimes undergo Lysis (dissolved and
disappeared) and that this lysis can be transferred
from one colony to other. Even highly diluted
material from lysed colony can transfer the lytic
efect. However, heating the iltrate destroyed
its lytic property. From these observations he
concluded that lytic agent might be a virus. D’Herelle
rediscovered this phenomena in 1917 and used the
word bacteriophages meaning “bacteria eater”.

Characteristics
Viruses are extremely small infectious agents, which can only be seen under an electron microscope.
They range in size from 250 nanometer (nm) of poxviruses to the 20 nm of parvoviruses. They are
10 to 1000 times smaller than most bacteria, so they can pass through the pores of ilter, from
which bacteria cannot pass. Viruses cannot be grown on artiicial media. They can reproduce only
in animal and plant cells or in microorganisms, where they reproduce by replication (a process by
which many copies or replicas of virus are formed). Thus the viruses are obligate intracellular
parasites. Viruses lack metabolic machinery for the synthesis of their own nucleic acid and protein.
They depend on the host cell to carry out these vital functions. During reproduction in the host
cells, viruses may cause disease. All viruses are generally resistant to broad range of available
antibiotics such as penicillin, streptomycin and others.
Structure
The complete, mature and infectious particle is known as virion. The virions are composed of
a central core of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, which is also known as the genome and is
surrounded by a protein coat, the capsid. Capsid gives deinite shape to virion. Capsid is made up
of protein subunits known as capsomeres. The number
of capsomeres is characteristics of a particular virus.
For example 162 capsomeres are present in the capsid
of herpes virus and 252 in the capsid of adenovirus
which cause some common colds. In some animal viruses
the nucleocapsid (nucleic acid and capsid) is covered
by another membrane derived from the host cell, the
envelope. Non enveloped viruses are known as naked
virions. Animal and plant viruses may be polyhedron
(having many sides), helical (Spiral), enveloped or complex.
Bacterio-phages occur in two structural forms having cubical or helical symmetry. In general
appearance cubical phages are regular solid or icosahedral (having 20 faces), and helical phages
are rod shaped. Many phages consist of head and tail. In those cases heads are polyhedral but
tails are rod shaped. Morphology of some viruses and bacteriophages has been shown in Fig 5.3.
The most recently discovered (1983) and least
upderstood micro organisms are the prions,
which may be infectious proteins. Their nature is
very controversial. They are composed of protein
only that contains the information that codes
for their own replication. All other organisms
contain their genetic information in nucleic acid
(DNA or RNA). Prions are responsible for mad
cow infection and mysterious brain infection in
man.

Life Cycle of Bacteriophages
Earlier researches on bacteriphages were mainly on limited number of phages that infect Escherichia
coli. Of these the best known phages are T phages (T for type).
Among T phages, the T2
 and T4
 phages are mainly used in phage studies. The overall structure of
T4
, studied with electron microscopy, resembles that of tadpole, consisting of head and tail (Fig
5.4). The head is an elongated pyramidal (having two triangular structures with common base),
hexagonal , prism -shaped structure, to which straight tail is attached. Within the head double
stranded DNA molecule is present. The structure of phage tail is more complex than head. A layer
of distinct protein forms the inner tube or core, which is enclosed in sheath made up of another
type of protein. On one side of sheath is collar and on other side is end plate. To end plate six tail
11
5. Variety of Life eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
 Fig. 5.4 A Bacteriophage
ibers are attached, which are the structures for attachment. The volume of the phage is about
1/1000 of the host.
The bacteriophage replicates only inside the bacterial cell. The irst step in the replication of a
bacteriophage is its attachment (adsorption) to host cell at receptor site on the cell wall of
bacterium. During attachment, week chemical union between virion and receptor site takes place.
In the next step, penetration, the tail releases the enzyme lysozyme to dissolve a portion of the
bacterial cell wall. The tail sheath contracts and tail core is forced into the cell through cell wall and
cell membrane. The virus injects its DNA into the cell just as the syringe is used to inject the vaccine.
The protein coat, which forms the phage head and tail structure of virus remains outside the cell
(Fig 5.5). Many animal viruses, however enter the host cell as a whole.
Immediately after entering the host cell , the viral nucleic acid takes the control of the host’s
biosynthetic machinery and induces the host cell to synthesize necessary viral components (DNA,
proteins), and starts multiplying. About 25 minutes after initial infection, approximately 200 new
12

bacteriophages are formed, bacterial cell bursts, i.e., it undergoes lysis. Newly formed phages are
released to infect the bacteria and another cycle, the lytic cycle begins (Fig. 5.6). The phage which
causes lysis of the host cell is known as lytic or virulent phage.

Fig. 5.6 Replication of a bacteriophage. After adsorption and penetration, the virus DNA undergoes prophage formation (1) In the
Iysogenic cycle, phages can exist harmlessly as a prophage with in the host cell for long periods of time. Each ti.ne the bacterial
chromosome is replicated, the prophage also is replicated, and hence all daughter bacterial cell are “infected”! with the prophage.
Induction involves either a spontaneous or environmentally induced excision of the prophage from the bacterial chromosome. (2) A
typical lytic cycle, involves synthesis and maturation of phage and new phages are released.
All infections of bacterial cells by phages do not result in lysis. In some cases viral DNA, instead of
taking over the control of host’s machinery, becomes incorporated into the bacterial chromosome.
Phage in this state is called prophage and this process is known as lysogeny. In this condition
the bacterium continues to live and reproduce normally. Viral DNA being the part of bacterial
chromosome passes to each daughter cell in all successive generations. Some times, however, the
viral DNA gets detached from the host’s chromosome and lytic cycle starts. This process is called
induction. Lysogenic bacteria are resistant to infection by the same or related phages. The phage
which causes lysogeny is called temperate (lysogenic) phage.

Classiication of Viruses
Virus morphology and nucleic acid properties are most important for classifying plant, animal and
bacterial viruses. The genetic material may be DNA or RNA naked, enveloped or complex. On the
basis of morphology viruses are classiied into rod shaped (T.M.V), spherical (poliovirus) and tadpole
like bacteriophage viruses etc. Fig. 3.5 and 5.4.
Some Viral Diseases
There are many diseases which are caused by viruses. Only those are being mentioned here which
have been or are common in Pakistan.
Small pox: Smallpox, which is caused by pox viruses (the DNA enveloped virus) is an ancient disease
that is known to have occurred as epidemic in China as early as the twelfth century B.C. Until the
early twentieth century , small pox was a common disease throughout the world. In small pox,
raised luid-illed vesicles are formed on the body which become pustules later on and form pitted
scars, the pocks. By 1950’s immunization and other control measures had largely decreased the
danger, but it is still present in the third world countries where many people are afected. In 1980,
it was declared by World Health Organization that small pox has been eradicated from the world.
Herpes simplex: Herpes virus (DNA virus) is responsible for this disease. It is naturally occurring
disease of mankind. In this vascular lesions in the epithelial layers of ectodermal tissues are formed.
Most commonly this disease occurs in the mouth, on the lips, and at other skin sites.
Inluenza: Inluenza viruses are enveloped RNA viruses. Inluenza is wide spread disease in man
and occurs in epidemic form.
Mumps and Measles: Mumps and Measles viruses belong to group paramyxoviruses. They are
large, enveloped, RNA viruses. Mumps is highly contagious, wide spread, but seldom fatal. About
60% of adults are immune to it. Measles is one of the commonest diseases of the childhood and
adult human population is equally susceptible the world over. This disease develops immunity in
its victim.
Polio: Poliomyelitis, caused by polio virus, is found all over the world . It occurs mostly in childhood.

The age at which primary infection occurs varies with social and economic factors. The polioviruses
are the smallest known viruses and contain RNA in spherical capsid. Some common human viral
dieases are shown in Fig 5.7.
Fig. 5.7 Some common human viral diseases
Retroviruses
RNA tumor viruses have been known for many years. These viruses are widely distributed in nature
and are associated with tumor production in a number of animal species, such as fowl, rodents
and cats. The most familiar of viruses is the human immunodeiciency virus (HIV) which causes
acquired immune deiciency syndrome (AIDS).
The single stranded RNA tumor viruses, which also include retroviruses (oncoviruses), are
spherical in form , about lOOnm in diameter and enveloped by host plasma membrane. Although
a few retroviruses are non speciic that is they can infect any cell, most of them can infect only host
17
5. Variety of Life eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
cells that possess required receptors. In the case of AIDS virus, the host cell possesses a receptor
that allows the viral adsorption and penetration in several types of leukocytes (white blood cells)
and tissue cells. The retroviruses have a special enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which can
convert a single -stranded RNA genome into double stranded viral DNA. Not only this DNA can
infect host cells, but it also can be incorporated into host genome as a provirus that can be passed
on to progeny cells. In this way, some of retroviruses can convert normal cells into cancer cells.
Acquired Immune Deiciency Syndrome (AIDS)
The AIDS was reported by some physicians in early 1980’s in young males having one or more of
complex symptoms such as severe pneumonia , a rare vascular cancer, sudden weight loss, swollen
lymph nodes and general loss of immune functions. All these young patients were homosexuals.
Soon after the disease was discovered in nonhomosexual patients who were given blood (blood
transfusion) or blood products. In 1984 the agent causing the disease was identiied by research
teams from Pasteur Institute in France and National Institute of health in USA. In 1986 the virus was
named as human immunodeiciency virus (HIV) (Fig 5.8). The major cell infected by HIV is the
helper T-lymphocyte, which is major component of immune system. As the HIV infection continues
in the host, the decrease of helper T-lymphocytes results in failure of the immuhe system and the
infected person becomes susceptible to other diseases. Cells in central nervous system can also be
infected by HIV Fig. 5.9. Recent studies on HIV reveal that the virus infects and multiplies in monkey
but does not cause disease in them, which means that HIV is host speciic.

The HIV is transmitted by intimate sexual contact, contact with blood and breast feeding. Healthcare
workers can also acquire HIV during professional activities. Avoiding the direct contact with HIV is
important measure for preventing the disease. Prevention of’ intravenous drugs with common
syringes and use of sterile needles/syringes and utensils is important. Now vaccine against HIV has
been synthesized and its experimental administration in humans started in early 2001 in South
Africa.

Hepatitis
Hepatitis is an inlammation of the liver. It is usually caused by viral infection, toxic agents or drugs.
It is characterized by jaundice, abdominal pain, liver enlargement, fatigue and some times fever. It
may be mild or can be acute and can lead to liver cancer. The diferent types of viral hepatitis are

individuals.) Hepatitis B (serum hepatitis). Hepatitis C (formerly called non-A, non-B hepatitis)
passes through blood, from mother to child during pregnancy and afterward and by sexual contact.
Hepatitis D (delta hepatitis), Hepatitis E (a virus transmitted through the faeces of an infected
person), Hepatitis F, G (caused by viruses yet unidentiied). Viruses of hepatitis A, B and C are
better known. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an RNA virus (non enveloped), which causes mild short
term, less virulent disease. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is also RNA virus (enveloped) causes infusion
hepatitis, which is less severe than hepatitis A or hepatitis B, but hepatitis C often leads to chronic
liver disease. Most recent work of Halbur and coworker (2001) reveals that pig could be the source
of infection of hepatitis E.
Hepatitis B (HBV) is the second major form of hepatitis. It is caused by DNA virus which is very
common in Asia, China, Philippines, Africa and the Middle East. Hepatitis B is transmitted by the
exchange of body luids, for example blood serum, breast milk and saliva, from mother to child
during birth or afterward and by sexual contact.. During acute attacks of Hepatitis B fatigue, loss of
appetite and jaundice are reported. Infected persons can recover completely and become immune
to the virus. People with chronic hepatitis infection are at the risk of liver damage. Hepatitis can be
controlled by adopting hygienic measures, with routine vaccination and screening of blood/ organ/
tissue of the donor.
Genetically engineered vaccine is available for HBV.
Vaccine is also available for HAV but not for HCV.

Kingdom Prokaryotae consists of organisms with prokaryotic cells. In Greek the word Pro means
“before” and karyon means nucleus. Microbiologists place bacteria in two major categories:
eubacteria (Greek for “true bacteria”) and a much smaller division, the archaeobacteria (Greek for
“ancient bacteria”).
DISCOVERY OF BACTERIA
It had long been suspected that small creatures exist which are too small to be seen with naked
eye. But their discovery was linked to the invention of microscope. A Dutch Scientist “AntonieVan
Leeuwenhoek” (1673) was the irst to report the microbes such as bacteria and protozoa. He used a
simple microscope to describe bacteria and protozoa with accurate drawings and descriptions and
called these small creatures as “animalcules”. He irstly observed small creatures in rain water,
then conirmed these in saliva, vinegar, infusions and other substances.
The progress in understanding the nature and importance of these tiny organisms has been slow. The
existance of microbes was further conirmed by Louis Pasteur’s work. Pasteur went on making many
discoveries in the ield’of microbiology and medicine. His main achievements are the development
of vaccines for disease anthrax, fowl cholera and rabies. He also made signiicant contributions
in development of pasteurization process and development of fermentation industries. He proved
that microorganisms could cause disease.
Rohert Koch formulated the ‘germ theory of disease’. He isolated typical rodshaped bacteria with
squarish ends (baccilli) from (he blood of sheep that had died of anthrax. Then he discovered
bacteria that caused tuberculosis and cholera. He formulated four postulates, which are the
main pillars of the germ theory of disease. These are used to ind out whether the organism found
in disease lesions is the causal agent of the disease or not.
1. A speciic organism can always be found in association with a given disease.
2. The organism can be isolated and grown in pure culture in the laboratory.
3. The pure culture will produce the disease when inoculated into susceptible animal.
4. It is possible to recover the organism in pure culture from experimentally infected animal.
Koch and his colleagues invented many techniques concerning inoculation, isolation, media
preparation, maintenance of pure cultures and preparation of specimens for microscopic
examinations.

OCCURRENCE OF BACTERIA
Bacteria are wide spread in their occurrence. They are found almost everywhere, in air, land, water,
oil deposits, food, decaying organic matter, plants, man and animals. Their kind and number vary
according to locality and environmental conditions. Some bacteria are always present and contribute
towards the natural lora. Others are present in speciic environments such as hot springs, alkaline/
acidic soil, highly saline environments, in highly polluted soils and waters.

STRUCTURE OF BACTERIA
All bacterial cells invariably have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosome, and chromatin bodies.
The majority have a cell wall, which gives shape to the bacterial cell. Speciic structures like capsule,
slime, lagella, pili, imbriae and granules are not found in all bacteria (refer to Fig. 4.17).
Size
Bacteria range in size from about 0.1 to 600 nm over a single dimension. Bacteria vary in size
as much as in shape. The smallest (e.g., some members of
the genus Mycoplasma) are about 100 to 200 nm in diameter,
approximately the size of the largest viruses (poxviruses)
Escherichia coli, a bacillus of about average size, is 1.1 to 1.5
nm wide by 2.0 to 6.0 nm long. Some spirochetes occasionally
reach 500 nm in length whereas Staphylococci and Streptococci
are 0.75 - 1.25n in diameter.
Shape of Bacteria
On the basis of general shape, bacteria are classiied into three categories. These shapes are known
as cocci, bacilli and spiral .Although most of the bacterial species have fairly constant characteristic
cell shape, yet some cells are pleomorphic and they can exist in a variety of shapes.
Recently a huge bacterium has been
discovered in the intestine of the brown
surgeonish, Acanthurus nigrofuscus.
Epulopiscium ishelsoni grows as large as
600 nm by 80 nm, a little smaller than a
printed hyphen. It is now clear that a few
bacteria are much larger than the average
eukaryotic cell.
Exceptions to the above shapes are
trichome forming, sheathed, stalked,
square, starshaped, spindle-shaped,
lobed and ilamentous bacteria.

The cocci are spherical or oval bacteria having one of several distinct arrangements based on their
planes of division. If division is in one plane it will produce either a diplococcus or streptococcus
arrangement. When cocci occur in pairs then
arrangement is diplococcus, whereas when
cocci form long chain of cells then arrangement
is called as streptococci. When the division of
cell is in two planes it will produce a tetrad
arrangement. A tetrad is a square of 4 cocci.
Thirdly, when the division is in three planes, it
will produce a sarcina arrangement. Sarcina is a
cube of 8 cocci. When division occurs in random
planes, it will produce a staphylococcus
arrangement in which cocci are arranged in
irregular, often grape-like clusters. Diplococcus
pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus are some
examples of cocci.

Bacilli are rod-shaped bacteria. Bacilli all
divide in one plane producing a bacillus,
streptobacillus, or diplobacillus. Bacillus
is a single cell of bacteria. Streptobacillus is
a chain of bacilli. When rod shaped bacteria
occur in pairs then arrangement of cells
is known as diplobacilli. Examples of rod
shaped bacteria are Escherichia coli, Bacillus
subtilis, Pseudomonas.
The spiral shaped bacteria are spirally
coiled. Spirals come in one of three forms, a
vibrio, a spirillum, or a spirochete. Vibrio
is curved or comma-shaped rod. Spirillum
is a thick, rigid spiral. Spirochete is a thin,
lexible spiral. Examples of spiral shaped
bacteria are Vibrio, Hyphomicrobium.

Bacterial Cell Structure
Flagella and their frictions : These are extremely thin, hair like appendages. They come out
through cell wall and originate from basal body, structure just beneath the cell membrane in the
cytoplasm. They are made up oif protein lagellin. On the basis of presence of lagella, pattern
of attachment of lagella and the number of lagella present bacteria are classiied into diferent
taxonomic groups. Atrichous means bacteria are without any lagella. When single polar lagellum
is present then condition is known as monotrichous. If tuft of lagella is present only at one pole of
bacteria then these are lophotrichous lagella. Amphitrichous is a condition when tuft of lagella at
each of two poles is present. In peritrichous form, lagella surround the whole cell. Most of bacilli
and spiral shaped bacteria have lagella. Cocci very rarely have lagella.
Primary function of lagella is to help in motility.With the help of lagella, lagellate bacteria can also
detect and move in response to chemical signals which is a type of behaviour called as Chemotaxis.

These are hollow, nonhelical, ilamentous appendages. Pili are smaller than lagella and are not
involved in motility. True pili are only present on gram-negative bacteria. They are made up of
special protein called pilin. They are primarily involved in a mating process between cells called
conjugation process. Some pili function as a means of attachment of bacteria to various surfaces.

The cell envelope: The outer wrapping of bacteria
Bacterial surface and walls are very diverse. Collectively complexes of layer external to the cell
protoplasm are called as cell envelope and include capsule, slime and cell wall.
Capsule : Bacteria produce capsule, which is made up of repeating polysaccharide units, and of
protein, or of both, capsule is tightly bound to the cell. It has a thicker, gummy nature that gives
sticky characters to colonies of encapsulated bacteria. It provides pathogenicity.
Slime : Some bacteria are covered with loose, soluble shield of macromolecules which is called
as slime capsule and slime provides greater pathogenicity to bacteria and protects them against
phagocytosis.
Cell Wall: Beneath the extracellular substances and external to cytoplasmic membrane cell wall
is present. It is a rigid structure. It determines the shape of bacterium. Cell wall also protect the
cells from osmotic lysis. Cell wall is only absent in mycoplasmas. Christain Gram developed the
technique of gram stain. Bacteria could be divided into two groups based on their response to gram
staining procedure. By this Staining technique Gram-positive bacteria are stained purple (retain
the primary dye due to formation of CV-I complex) and Gram-negative bacteria are stained pink
(retain secondary dye) in colour. There are many structural diferences between two groups (Table
6.1) which are the primary basis for diference in staining behaviour.

The cell walls of most bacteria have a unique macromolecule called as peptidoglycan. Its amount
varies in diferent types of bacteria. It is composed of framework of long glycan chains cross-linked
with peptide fragments. The intact cell wall also contains chemical constituents such as sugar
molecules, teichoic acid, lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides, which are linked to peptidoglycan.
Several bacterial groups lack the cell wall structure characteristic of Gram positive or Gram negative
bacteria, and some bacteria have no cell wall at all. Cell walls of archacnbactcria are diferent
from eubacteria. They do not contain peptidoglycan. Their cell walls are composed of proteins,
glycoproteins and polysaccharides).
Cell Membrane
Just beneath the cell wall is the cell membrane or plasma membrane. It is very thin, lexible and
completely surrounds the cytoplasm. Plasma membrane is very delicate in nature any damage to
it results in death o f the organism. Bacterial membranes difer from eukaryotic membranes in
lacking sterols such as cholesterol.
Cell membrane regulates the transport of proteins, nutrients, sugar and electrons or other
metabolites. The plasma membranes of bacteria also contain enzymes for respiratory metabolism.
 Cytoplasmic matrix
The cytoplasm of prokaryotic cell lacks membrane bound organelles and cytoskeleton (microtubules).
The cytoplasmic matrix is the substance present between the plasma membrane and the nucleoid.
It has gel like consistency. Small molecules can move through it rapidly. The plasma membrane
and every thing present within it is known as protoplast. Thus the cytoplasmic matrix is a major
part of protoplast. Other large discrete structures such as chromatin /nuclear body, ribosomes,
mesosomes and granules and nucleoid are present in this matrix.

membrane. The nuclear material or DNA in bacterial cells occupies a position near to the center
of cell. This material is a single, circular and double
stranded DNA molecule. It aggregates as an
irregular shaped dense area called the nucleoid.
This chromatin body is actually an extremely long
molecule of DNA that is tightly folded so as to it
inside the cell component. Since bacteria have a
single chromosome, they are haploid.
Plasmid
Many bacteria contain plasmids in addition to chromosomes. These are the circular, double stranded DNA molecules. They are self-replicating and are not essential for bacterial growth and metabolism. They often contain drug resistant, heavy metals, disease and insect resistant genes on them.
Ribosomes
Ribosomes are composed of RNA and proteins. Some may also be loosely attached to plasma
membranes. They are protein factories. There are thousands of ribosomes in each healthy growing
cell. They are smaller than eukaryotic ribosomes.
Mesosomes
The cell membrane, invaginates into the cytoplasm forming structure called as mesosome.
Mesosomes are’in the form of vesicles, tubules or lamellae. Mesosomes are involved in DNA
replication and cell division where as some mesosomes are also involved in export of exocellular
enzyme. Respiratory enzymes are also present on the mesosomes.
Granules and storage bodies
Since bacteria exist in a very competitive environment where nutrients are usually in short supply.
They tend to store extra nutrients when possible. These may be glycogen, sulphur, fat and
phosphate. In addition, cells contain waste materials that are subsequently excreted. For example,
common waste materials are alcohol, lactic acid and acetic acid.
Spores
Certain species of bacteria produce spores, either external to the vegetative cells (exospores) or
Other names for nucleoid are nuclear body, chromatin
body and nuclear region.

within the vegetative cells (endospores). They are metabolically dormant bodies and are produced
at a late-stage of cell growth. Spores are resistant to adverse physical environmental conditions
such as light, high temperature, desiccation, pH and chemical agents, Under favorable conditions
they germinate and form vegetative cells.
Cysts
Cysts are dormant, thick-walled, desiccation resistant forms and develop during diferentiation of
vegetative cells which can germinate under suitable condition. They are not heat resistant.
Nutrition of Bacteria
Like other organisms bacteria need energy for their growth, maintenance and reproduction. Most
bacteria are heterotrophic i.e.. they cannot synthesize their organic compounds from simple
inorganic substances. They live either as saprophytes or as parasites. Saprophytic bacteria get
their food from dead organic matter. Soil is full of organic compounds in the form of humus. Humus
is the material resulting from the partial decay of plants and animals. Many soil inhabiting bacteria
have vety extensive enzyme system that breaks down the complex substances of humus to simpler
compounds. The bacteria can then absorb and utilize these simpler substances as a source of
energy. Parasitic bacteria for their nutrition are fully dependent on their host.
Some kinds of bacteria are auotrophic i.e., they can synthesize organic compounds which are
necessary for their survival from inorganic substances.These bacteria may be separated into two
groups : photosynthetic autotrophs and chemosynthetic autotrophs. Photosynthetic bacteria
possess chlorophyll which difers from the chlorophyll of green plants. Unlike most green plants,
which have their chlorophyll in chloroplasts, bacterial chlorophyll is dispersed in the cytoplasm.
During photosynthesis the autotrophic bacteria utilize hydrogen sulphide (H2
S) instead of water as
a hydrogen source and liberate sulphur instead of oxygen. Nitrifying bacteria are chemosynthetic.
Chemosynthetic bacteria oxidize inorganic compounds like ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, sulphur or
ferrous iron and trap the energy thus released for their synthetic reactions. The overall reaction of
photosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria can be written as :

 Light
 CO2
 + 2H2
S $ (CH2O)
n
 + H2O +2S
 Chlorophyll
Green sulphur bacteria, purple sulphur bacteria and purple non-sulphur bacteria are photosynthetic
bacteria.

Respiration in Bacteria
Respiration in bacteria may be aerobic (requiring free oxygen) or anaerobic not requiring free
oxygen. Bacteria, which are able to grow in the presence of oxygen, are called aerobic bacteria. While
those which can grow in the absence of oxygen are known
as anaerobic bacteria. Some bacteria are neither aerobic
nor anaerobic, but facultative. Facultative bacteria grow
either in the presence or absence of oxygen. Some bacteria
require a low concentration of oxygen for growth and are
known as microaerophilic.
Growth and Reproduction
Bacterial growth refers commonly to increase in number of bacterial cells. Bacteria increase in
number by an asexual means of reproduction, called binary ission. In binary ission parent cell
enlarges, its chromosome duplicates, and plasma membrane pinches inward at the center of the
cell. When nuclear material has been evenly distributed, the cell wall grows inward to separate cell
into two. This sequence is repeated at intervals by each new daughter cell which in turn increases
the population of cells. Once the division is complete, bacteria grow and develop their unique
features. The interval of time until the completion of next division is known as generation time.
Four distinct phases are recognized in bacterial growth curve.

Spirochete is an anaerobic bacterium.
E.coli is a facultative anaerobic bacterium.

1) Lag phase: It is phase of no growth. Bacteria prepare themselves for division.
2) Log phase: It is phase of rapid growth. Bacteria divide at exponential rate.
3) Stationary phase: Bacterial death rate is equal to bacterial rate of reproduction and
 multiplication.
4) Death/Decline phase: Bacteria start dying. Here the death rate is more than reproduction
 rate.
Bacteria lack traditional sexual reproduction and mitosis. However, some bacteria transfer genetic
material from a donor bacterium to a recipient during a process called conjugation. Some
conjugating bacteria use specialized sex pili to transfer genetic material. Conjugation produces
new genetic combinations that may allow the resulting bacteria to survive under great variety of
conditions.
IMPORTANCE OF BACTERIA
Ecological importance
Bacteria are ecologically very important. They are highly adaptable as a group and are found nearly
everywhere. They are able to decompose organic matter and play a signiicant role in the completion
of cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and carbon.
Economic Importance
Bacteria are used in number of industries, including food, drugs (production of antibiotics and
vaccines) and in biotechnology. Bacteria are also responsible for spoilage of food and vegetables.
Many plant pathogens adversely afect the agricultural industry.
Medical Importance
Bacteria are very common pathogens of humans. Approximately 200 species are known to cause
diseases in humans. Many bacteria normally inhabit the bodies of man and other animals.
Control of bacteria
Control of microorganisms is essential in home, industry as well as in medical ields . By controlling
microorganisms one can prevent and treat diseases. Spoilage of foods and other industrial products
can be inhibited by controlling microorganisms.
15
6. Kingdom prokaryotae(Monera) eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
 Microorganisms can be controlled by various methods.
Physical methods : In this, steam, dry heat, gas, iltration and radiation are used to control
bacteria. The process in which we use physical agents to control bacteria/microorganism is known
as sterilization process. Sterilization is destruction of all life forms.
High temperature is usually used in microbiological labs for control of microbes. Both dry heat and
moist heat are efective. Moist heat causes coagulation of proteins and kills the microbes. Dry heat
causes oxidation of chemical constituents of microbes and kills them.
Certain electromagnetic radiations below 300 nm are efective in killing of microorganisms. Gamma
rays are in general used for sterilization process.
Heat sensitive compounds like antibiotics, seras,-hormones etc. can be sterilized by means of
membrane ilters.
Chemical methods: One can use antiseptics, disinfectants and chemotherapeutic agents
for microbial control. Chemical substances used on living tissues that inhibit the growth of
microorganism are called antiseptics.
The important chemical agents used for disinfection are oxidising and reducing agents. For example
halogens and phenols, hydrogen peroxide, Potassium permanganate, alcohol and formaldehyde
etc. inhibit the growth of vegetative cells and are used on nonliving materials.
Chemotherapeutic agents and antibiotics work with
natural defense and stop the growth of bacteria and
other microbes. These are Sulfonamides, tetracycline;
penicillin, etc. They destroy or inhibit the growth of
microorganisms in living tissues.
Immunization and Vaccination : Methods
of prevention and treatment that have been introduced to control microbial diseases include
immunization (e.g. vaccination), antisepsis (procedures to eliminate or reduce the possibility of
infection), chemotherapy and public health measures (e.g. water puriication, sewage disposal,
and food preservation).
Microbicidal efect is one that kills the microbes
immediately
Microbistatic inhibits the reproductive capacities of
the cells and maintains the microbial population at
constant size.
Modes oI action of diferent chemical and physical
agents of control vary. Damage can result malfunctions
in cell wall, cell membranes, cytoplasmic enzymes, or
nucleic acid.

Pasteur made many discoveries concerning the cause and prevention of infectious diseases. In
1880’s he isolated the bacterium responsible for chicken cholera. He grew it in a pure culture. To
prove that he really had isolated the bacterium responsible for this disease Pasteur made use of the
fundamental techniques devised by Koch. He arranged experiments for a public demonstration in
which he repeated an experiment that had been successful in many previous trials in his laboratory.
He inoculated healthy chicken with his pure cultures and waited for them to develop chicken
cholera and die. But to his dismay, the chickens failed to get sick and die. Reviewing each step
of the experiment, Pasteur found that he had accidentally used the cultures several weeks old
instead of fresh one grown especially for the demonstration. He soon discovered that somehow
bacteria could lose their virulence, or ability to produce disease, after standing and growing old. But
these attenuated, or less virulent, bacteria could still stimulate the host (in this case the chicken) to
produce antibodies, substances that protect the host (in this case the chicken) against infection due
to subsequent exposure to the virulent organism.
Pasteur next applied this principle of inoculation with attenuated cultures to the prevention of
anthrax, and again it worked. He called the attenuated cultures of bacterial vaccine (a term derived
from the Latin Vacca, “cow”) and immunization with attenuated cultures of bacteria, vaccination.
Pasteur honoured Edward Jenner (1749-1823), who had successfully vaccinated a boy against
small pox in 1796. Jenner had learned that milkmaids who contracted cowpox from the cows, they
milked, never subsequently contracted the much more virulent small pox. Accordingly he tested
this hypothesis by inoculating young James Phipps irst with cowpox causing material and later
with small pox causing material. The boy did not get small pox.
Then Pasteur also made a vaccine for hydrophobia, or rabies, a disease transmitted to people by
bites from rabid dogs, cats, and other animals.
USE AND MISUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS
Antibiotics is a Greek word (Anti-against-and Bios life). Antibiotics are the chemotherapeutic
chemical substances which are used in treatment of infectious diseases. Antibiotics are synthesized
and secreted by certain bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi. Today, some antibiotics are synthesized
in the laboratory. However, their origins are living cells. To determine drug of choice, one must
17
6. Kingdom prokaryotae(Monera) eLearn.Punjab

know its mode of action, possible adverse side efects in
the human beings.
Massive quantities of antibiotics are being prepared and used, which are followed by the widespread
problems of drug resistance in microorganisms. This results in an increasing resistance against
disease treatments. Misused antibiotics can interact with the human metabolism and in severe
cases can cause death of human beings. Misuse of antibiotic such as penicillin can cause allergic
reactions. Similarly streptomycin can afect auditory nerve thus causing deafness. Tetracycline and
its related compounds cause permanent discoloration of teeth in young children.
CHARACTERISTICS OF CYANOBACTERIA
The cyanobacteria are the largest and most diverse group of photosynthetic bacteria which was
previously known as ‘blue green algae’. Cyanobacteria are true prokaryotes. They vary greatly in
shape and appearance. They range in diameter from about 1-10um and may be unicellular, exist as
colonies of many shapes, or form ilaments consisting of trichomes (chains of cells) surrounded
by mucilaginous sheath. They have normal Gram-negative type cell wall. They lack lagella and
often use gas vesicles to move in the water, and many ilamentous species have gliding motility.
Their photosynthetic system closely resembles that of eukaryotes because they have chlorophyll
a and photosystem II.They carry out oxygenic photosynthesis, i.e., they use water as an electron
donor and generate oxygen during photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria use phycobilins as accessory
pigments. Photosynthetic pigments and electron transport chain components are located in
thylakoid membranes linked with particles called phycobilisomes. Phycocyanin pigment (blue) is
their predominant phycobilin and C02
 in them is assimilated through the Calvin cycle.
Reserve food material in cyanobacteria is glycogen. Cyanobacteria reproduce by binary ission,
fragmentation. In cyanobacteria hormogonia, akinetes and heterocysts are present.
Use antibiotics as prescribed by the physicians.
Take dose at regular intervals and complete the
treatment as advised by the doctor.

ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE
They help in reclamation of alkaline soils . Cyanobacteria have heterocysts, which are helpful in the
ixation of atmospheric nitrogen. They release O2
 in the environment due to their photosynthetic
activity. Oscillatoria and few other cyanobacteria
can be used as pollution indicator. They have
symbiotic relationship with protozoa, fungi,
and nitrogen ixing species form associations
with angiosperms. They are photosynthetic
partners in most of lichen association.
Many species of cyanobacteria form water blooms where they often impart unpleasant smell and
due to large amount of suspended organic matter water becomes unit for consumption. Some
species produce toxins that kill live stock and other animals that drink the water.
Super Blue green algae are basically expensive pond scum, in
which cyanobacterium is a single celled organism that produces
its own food through photosynthesis. It serves as a “complete
whole food“ which contain 60% protein with all essential amino
acids in perfect balance.

V: 1.1
NOSTOC
Habitat and occurrence
Nostoc is common as terrestrial and subaerial cyanobacterium. It is widely distributed in alkaline
soils and on moist rocks and clifs. Nostoc forms a jelly like mass in which numerous ilaments are
embedded.
Structure
Trichomes are unbranched and appear beaded. Individual cells are mostly spherical but some
times barrel shaped or cylindrical.
All cells in trichome are mostly similar in structure but at intervals are found slightly large , round,
light yellowish thick walled cells called as heterocysts. Trichome mostly breaks near heterocyst
and forms hormogonia and thus help in fragmentation.
Reproduction
There is no sexual reproduction but it reproduces asexually by formation of hormogonia.
Hormogonia are formed when ilament break at diferent points into smaller pieces.This is due to
death and decay of the ordinary cell or the heterocyst may serve as a breaking point. Reproduction
can also be due to akinete formation. Akinetes are thick walled , enlarged vegetative cells which
accumulate food and become resting cells. On arrival of favourable conditions they form normal
vegetative cell.

7. The Kingdom Protista (or protoctista) eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The Kingdom Protista consists of a vast assortment of primarily aquatic eukaryotic organisms whose
diverse body forms, types of reproduction, modes of nutrition and lifestyles make them diicult to
characterize. Basically, this kingdom is deined by exclusion i.e., all members have characteristics
that exclude them from the other four kingdoms.
All protists are eukaryotic and have evolved from prokaryotes. Another reason for creating a
separate kingdom arises from the diiculty in placing certain eukaryotic organisms in the appropriate
kingdom. This diiculty is a consequence of the fact that the other eukaryotic kingdoms have their
evolutionary origin in kingdom Protista. The other eukaryotic kingdoms Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia
arose from protists in various ways.
The protists are unicellular, colonial or simple multi cellular organisms that possess a eukaryotic
cell organization. Eukaryotic cells, the unifying feature of protists, are common to complex multicellular organisms belonging to the three eukaryotic kingdoms (Fungi, Plantae and Animalia) but
clearly diferentiate protists from members of the prokaryotic kingdom (Monera). Unlike plants
and animals, however, protists do not develop from a blastula or an embryo.
The kingdom protista contains four major groups of eukaryotic organisms which are : single celled
protozoans, unicellular algae, multicellular algae, slime molds and oomycotes.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
In 1861, John Hogg proposed the kingdom Protoctista for microscopic organisms. In 1866, Ernst
Haeckel suggested creating the Kingdom Protista to include bacteria and other microorganisms
(such as Euglena) that kingdom. He, however, separated blue green algae and bacteria (prokaryotes)
from nucleated protists and placed them in a separate group he called Monera, within the kingdom
Protista.
In 1938, Herbert Copeland elevated the prokaryotes to kingdom status, thus separating them from
Protista. In ive kingdom system of Robert Whittaker (1969) only unicellular eukarayotes were
placed in kingdom Protista. Currently this kingdom also includes colonial and simple multicellular
eukaryotes as well. Margulis and Schwartz (1988) modiied the ive kingdom system. Protista or
Protoctista is one of the ive kingdoms.

DIVERSITY AMONG PROTISTA
During the course of evolutionary history, organisms in the kingdom protista have evolved diversity
in their (a) size and structure, (b) means of locomotion, (c) ways of obtaining nutrients, (d) interactions
with other organisms, (e) habitat and (f) modes of reproduction. Diversity is exhibited by all of the
major protist groups (Fig. 7.1).
Based on the diversity, most biologists regard the protists kingdom as a polyphyletic group of
organisms; that is, the protists probably do not share a single common ancestor. Margulis and
Schwartz have listed 27 phyla to accommodate this diverse assemblage of organisms.
MAJOR GROUPS OF PROTISTA

 The Giant Amoeba
The giant amoeba Pelomyxa palustris may
be the most primitive of all eukaryote
like forms. This species has multiple
membrane-bound nuclei but none of
the other organelles found in all other
eukaryotes. The giant amoebas obtain
energy from methanogenic bacteria, which
reside inside them. Giant amoebas inhabit
mud at the bottom of freshwater ponds,
where they contribute to the degradation
of organic molecules
(b) Zoolagellates:
These protists are mostly unicellular (a few are colonial) organisms with spherical or elongated
bodies with a single central nucleus. They possess from one to many long, whip-like lagella that
enable them to move. Flagellates move rapidly, pulling themselves forward by lashing lexible
lagella, that are usually located at the anterior end.
Flagellates obtain their food either by ingesting living or dead organisms or by absorbing nutrients
from dead or decomposing organic matter. They may be free-living, symbionts or parasites.
Trichonymphas are complex, specialized lagellates with many lagella which live as symbionts in
the guts of termites and help in the digestion of dry wood (Fig. 7.3a)

Choanolagellates are sessile marine or freshwater
lagellates which are attached by a stalk and their single
lagellum is surrounded by a delicate collar. They are of
special interest because of their striking resemblance to
collar cells in sponges (Fig. 7.4).

(c) Ciliates
Ciliates are unicellular organisms with a lexible outer covering called a pellicle that gives them
a deinite but changeable shape. In Paramecium, the surface of the cell is covered with several
thousand ine, short, hair-like structures called cilia. The cilia beat in such a precisely coordinated
fashion that the organism can go forward, can also go back and turn around.
Some ciliates are sessile and remain attached to a rock or other surface. Their cilia set up water
currents that draw food towards them. Most ciliates ingest bacteria or other tiny protists.

Water regulation in freshwater ciliates is controlled by special organelles called contractile vacuoles.
Ciliates difer from other protozoans in having two kinds of nuclei. One or more small diploid
micronuclei that function in sexual process, and a large, polyploid macronucleus that controls cell
metabolism and growth. Most ciliates are capable of a sexual process called conjugation. During
conjugation two individuals come together and exchange genetic material (Fig. 7.5).

(d) Foraminiferans and Actinopods
These marine protozoans produce shells (or tests). Tests of foraminifera are made of calcium whereas
those of actinopods are made of silica. The shells or tests contain pores through which cytoplasmic
projections can be extended. These cytoplasmic projections form a sticky, interconnected net that
entangles prey. Dead foraminiferans sink to the bottom of the ocean where their shells form a grey
mud that is gradually transformed into chalk. Foraminiferans of the past have created vast limestone
deposits.

(c) Radiolarians are actinopods with glassy shells.
(e) Apicomplexans
Apicomplexans are a large group of parasitic protozoa, some of which cause serious diseases such
as malaria in humans. Apicomplexans lack speciic structures for locomotion but move by lexing.
At some stage in their lives, they develop a spore, a small infective agent transmitted to the next
host. Many Apicomplexans spend part of their life in one host and part in a diferent host species
(Fig. 7.7).

 Fig. 7.7 The life cycle of the malarial parasite (Plasmodium).
Plasmodium, the apicomplexan that causes malaria, enters human blood through the bite of an
infected female Anopheles mosquito. Plasmodium irst enters liver cells and then red blood cells,
where it multiplies. When each infected red blood cell bursts, many new parasites are released.
The released parasites infect new red blood cells, and the process is repeated. The simultaneous
bursting of millions of red cells causes the symptoms of malaria; a chill, followed by high fever
caused by toxic substances that are released and afect other organs of the body (Fig. 7.7).
2. The Algae: Plan t like protists
Algae (singular alga) are photosynthetic protists, carrying out probably 50 to 60 percent of all the
photosynthesis on earth (plants account for most of the rest).
Algae difer from the plants in their sex organs which are unicellular and the zygote is not protected
by the parent body. A plant zygote, on the other hand, grows into a multicellular embryo that is
12
7. The Kingdom Protista (or protoctista) eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
protected by parental tissue.
Algae exhibit a remarkable range of growth forms. Some are unicellular; others are ilamentous.
Filaments are composed either of distinct cells or coenocytes (multinucleate structures that lack
cross-walls), still others (e.g. seaweeds) are multicellular and intricately branched or arranged in
leaf-like extensions. A body which is not diferentiated into true roots, stems and leaves and lacks
xylem & phloem is called a thallus.
In addition to green chlorophyll a, yellow and orange carotenoids, which are photosynthetic pigments
are found in all algae, other algal phyla possess a variety of other pigments (such as xanthophylls
and phycoerythrin) that are also important in photosynthesis. Classiication into phyla is largely
based on their pigment composition.
Algal life cycles show extreme variation, but all algae except members of the phylum Rhodophyta
(red algae) have forms with lagellated motile cells in at least one stage of their life cycle.
Almost all algae are aquatic. When actively growing, algae are restricted to damp or wet environments,
such as the ocean; freshwater ponds, lakes, and streams; hot springs; polar ice; moist soil, trees,
and rocks. Table 7.2 summarizes the classiication of algae.

(I) The Euglenoids
Euglenoids have at various times been
classiied in the plant kingdom (with algae)
and in animal kingdom (in protozoans). Based
on molecular data, euglenoids are thought
to be closely related to zoolagellates. They
are plant like in their pigments. However,
some photosynthetic euglenoids lose their
chlorophyll when grown in dark and obtain
their nutrients heterotrophically by ingesting
organic matter. Other species of euglenoids
are always colourless and heterotrophic (Fig.
7.8).

(ii) Dinolagellates
One of the most unusual protist phyla is that of dinolagellates. Most dinolagellates are unicellular.
Their cells are often covered with shells of interlocking cellulose plates impregnated with silicates.
Ecologically, dinolagellates are one of the most important groups of producers (second only to
diatoms) in marine ecosystem. Dinolagellates are known to have occasional population explosions
or blooms. These blooms frequently colour the water orange, red or brown and are known as red
tides (Fig. 7.9).

(iii) Diatoms
The cell wall of each diatom consists of two shells that overlap where they it together, much like a
petri dish. Silica is deposited in the shell, and this glasslike material is laid down in intricate patterns.
Fig. 7.10 Diatoms have silica shells with extremely beautiful symmetrical patterns
Diatoms are the major producers in the aquatic (marine and freshwater) ecosystems because of
their extremely large numbers. Diatoms are very important in aquatic food chains (Fig. 7.10).

(iv) Brown Algae
Brown algae include the giants of the protist kingdom. All brown algae are multicellular and range
from a few centimeters to approximately 75 meters in length. The largest brown algae, called the
kelps are tough and leathery in appearance. They possess lealike blades, stemlike stipes, and
rootlike anchoring holdfast. Brown algae are common in cooler marine waters, especially along
rocky coastlines in the intertidal zone (Fig. 7.11).

The multicellular body form of red algae is commonly composed
of complex interwoven ilaments that are delicate and feathery. A
few red algae are lattened sheets of cells. Most multicellular red
algae attach to rocks or other substances by a basal holdfast. Some
red algae incorporate calcium carbonate in their cell walls from the
ocean and take part in building coral reefs alongwith coral animals
(Fig. 7.12).

(vi) Green Algae
Green algae have pigments, energy reserve products, and cell walls that are identical to those of
plants. Green algae are photosynthetic, with chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids present
in the chloroplasts. Their main energy reserves are stored as starch. Most green algae possess
cell walls with cellulose. Because of these and other similarities it is generally accepted that plants
arose from ancestral green algae. Evidence from RNA sequencing also indicates that green algae
and the plants form a monophyletic lineage (Fig. 7.13).

photosynthesis as well as being investigated
as an alternate source of food.

Importance of Algae
Algae have great economic and environmental importance for us. Some algae such as kelps are
edible and may be used to overcome shortage of food in the world. Marine algae are also source of
many useful substances like algin, agar, carrageenan, and antiseptics. Algae are major producers
of the aquatic ecosystem, thus they play a basic role in food chains, providing food and oxygen to
other organisms.
3. FUNGUS-LIKE PROTISTS
Some protists supericially resemble fungi in that they are not photosynthetic and some have bodies
formed of threadlike structures called hyphae. However, funguslike protists are not fungi for several
reasons. Many of these protists have centrioles and produce cellulose as a major component of
their cell walls, whereas fungi lack centrioles and have cell walls of chitin. Two major groups of
fungus-like protists are : Slime molds and water molds (oomycotes).
(i) Slime molds or Myxomycota
The feeding stage of a slime mold is a plasmodium, a multinucleate mass of cytoplasm that can
grow to 30 cm (1 ft) in diameter. The plasmodium, which is slimy in appearance, streams over damp,
Fig. 7.14 Slime mold Physarum (a) The plasmodium is a naked mass of cytoplasm having many nuclei. (b) Reproductive structures
are stalked sporangia.

decaying logs and leaf litter. It often forms a network of channels that cover a large surface area. As
it creeps along, it ingests bacteria, yeasts, spores and decaying organic matter (Fig. 7.14).
During unfavourable condition, slime mold forms resistant haploid spore by meiosis within stalked
structures called sporangia. When conditions become favourable again, spores germinate into
bilagellated or amoeboid reproductive or swarm cells which unite to form diploid zygote. Zygote
produces multinucleate plasmodium, each nucleus being diploid.
The plasmodial slime mold Physarum polycephalum is a model organism that has been used to
study many fundamental biological processes, such as growth and diferentiation, cytoplasmic
streaming, and the function of cytoskeleton.

Water molds or Oomycotes
Oomycotes show close relations with the fungi and have a similar structure, but are now regarded
as more ancient group. Their cell walls contain cellulose, not chitin. Their hyphae are aseptate
(without cross walls). Oomycotes include a number of pathogenic organisms, including Phytophthora
infestans, which have played infamous roles in human history.
Fig. 7.15 Phytoplithora infestans growing in a diseased potato leaf, with sporangiophores emerging from the underside of the leaf.
Phytophthora infestans was the cause of Irish potato famine of the 19th century. It causes a disease
commonly known as late blight of potatoes. Because of several rainy, cool summers in Ireland in
the 1840’s, the water mold multiplied unchecked, causing potato tubers to rot in the ields. Since
potatoes were the staple of Irish peasants’ diet, many people (250,000 to more than 1 million)
starved to death. The famine prompted a mass migration out of Ireland to such countries as the
United States (Fig. 7.15).

Approximately 100,000 species of organisms called “fungi” are known and many more are
estimated to be present. This group includes notorious pathogens such as disastrous rusts, smuts
of wheat and com, and molds found growing on important crops and foodstuf. Delicacies such as
mushrooms, trules and morels, and other organisms of commercial use such as Penicillium - the
source of antibiotic penicillin, and the yeasts - used in bakeries and breweries are also members
of this group. Ecological role of fungi as decomposers is paralleled only by bacteria.
Taxonomic status of fungi has changed from that of ‘a group of Plant kingdom’ to a separate
kingdom “Fungi”. They resemble plants in some respects - have cell wall, lack centrioles and are
non-motile. But fungi resemble more animals than plants. Unlike plants and like animals, fungi are
heterotrophs, lack cellulose in their cell wall and contain chitin - the chemical found in external
skeleton of arthropods. For this reason, some mycologists (scientists who study fungi) think that
fungi and animals probably arose from a common ancestor. But fungi are diferent from animals
in having cell wall, being absorptive heterotrophs and non-motile. So fungi are neither plants nor
animals. Their DNA studies also conirm that they are diferent from all other organisms. They show
a characteristic type of mitosis, called ‘nuclear mitosis’. During nuclear mitosis, nuclear envelope
does not break; instead the mitotic spindle forms within the nucleus and the nuclear membrane
constricts between the two clusters of daughter chromosomes. (In some fungi nuclear envelope
dismantles late). Because fungi are distinct from plants, animals and protists in many ways, they
are assigned to a separate kingdom ‘Fungi’.
THE BODY OF FUNGUS
The body of a fungus, called mycelium, consists of long, slender, branched tubular thread like
filaments called the hyphae (singular hypha). Hyphae spread extensively over the surface of
substratum. Chitin in their wall is more resistant to decay than are cellulose and lignin which
make up plant cell wall. Hyphae may be septate or non-septate. Septate hyphae are divided by
cross-walls called septa (singular septum) into individual cells containing one or more nuclei. Nonseptate hyphae lack septa and are not divided into individual cells; instead these are in the form
of an elongated multinucleated large cell. Such hyphae are called coenocytic hyphae, in which
cytoplasm moves effectively, distributing the materials throughout. Septa of many septate fungi
3
8. Fungi The Kingdom of Recyclers eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
have a pore through which cytoplasm flows from cell to cell, carrying the materials to growing tips
and enabling the hyphae to grow rapidly when food and water are abundant and temperature is
favourable. All parts of fungus growing through the substrate are metabolically active. Extensive
spreading system of hypae provides enormous surface area for absorption.

hypha with porous septa and monokaryotic cells (e) A septate hypha with dikaryotic cell.
Hyphae may be packed together and organized to form complex
reproductive structures such as mushrooms, puf balls, morels etc.
which can expand rapidly. Yeast are non-hyphal unicellular fungi.
All fungal nuclei are haploid except for transient diploid zygote
that forms during sexual reproduction.
NUTRITION IN FUNGI
All fungi lack chlorophyll and are heterotrophs (obtaining carbon and energy from organic
matter). They obtain their food by direct absorption from the immediate environment and are
thus absorptive heterotrophs. Most fungi are saprotrophs (or saprobes), decomposers that
obtain their food (energy, carbon and nitrogen) directly from dead organic matter. They secrete out
digestive enzymes which digest dead organic matter, and the organic molecules thus produced
A single mycelium may produce upto
a kilometer of new hyphae in only one
day. A circular clone of Armillaria, a
pathogenic fungus alicting conifers,
growing out from a central focus, has
been measured upto 15 hectares (1
hectare = 10000 m2
). Could it be the
world’s largest organism?

are absorbed back into the fungus. Saprobic fungi anchor to the substrate by modiied hyphae,
the rhizoids. Fungi are the principal decomposers of cellulose and lignin, the main components
of plant cell walls (most bacteria cannot break them). Extensive system of fast growing hyphae
provides enormous surface for absorptive mode of nutrition. Saprobic fungi, alongwith bacteria,
are the major decomposers of the biosphere, contributing to the recycling of the elements (C, N, P,
0, H etc) used by living things.
Some fungi are parasites, some are even predators, and still others are mutualists. Parasitic
fungi absorb nutrients directly from the living host cytoplasm with the help of special hyphal tips
called haustoria. They may be obligate or facultative. Obligate parasites can grow only on their
living host and cannot be grown on available deined growth culture medium. Various mildews
and most rust species are obligate parasites. Facultative parasites can grow parasitically on their
host as well as by themselves on artiicial growth media.
Some fungi are active predators. The oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) is an omnivorous
(predatory) fungus. It paralyses the nematodes (that feed on this fungus), penetrate them, and
absorb their nutritional contents, primarily to fulil its nitrogen requirements. It fulills its glucose
requirements by breaking the wood. Some species of Arthrobotrys trap soil nematodes by forming
constricting ring, their hyphae invad and digest the unlucky victim. Other predators have other
adaptations, such as secretion of sticky substances.

is trapped in constricting ring of a soil - dwelling carnivorous fungus (Arthrobotrys sp.).

Fungi form two key mutualistic symbiotic associations (associations of beneit to both partners).
These are lichens and mycorrhizae.
Lichens are mutualistic symbiotic associations between certain fungi (mostly Ascomycetes and
imperfect fungi, and few Basidiomycetes - about 20 out of 15000 species of lichens) and certain
photoautotrophs-either green algae or a cyanobacterium, or some times both. Most of the visible
part of lichen consists of fungus, and algal components are present within the hyphae (Fig 8.3).
Fungus protects the algal partner from strong light and desiccation and itself gets food through the
courtesy of alga.
Lichens can grow at such places where neither of the components alone can, even at harsh places
such as bare rocks etc. Lichens vary in colour, shape, overall appearance, growth form (Fig 8.3).
They are ecologically very important as bioindicators of air pollution.

Mycorrhizae are mutualistic association between certain fungi and roots of vascular plants (about
95% of all kinds of vascular plants). The fungal hyphae dramatically increase the amount of soil
contact and total surface area for absorption and help in the direct absorption of phosphorus, zinc,
copper and other nutrients from the soil into the roots. Such plants show better growth than those
without this association. The plant, on the other hand, supplies organic carbon to fungal hyphae.
There are two main types of mycorrhizae (Fig 8.4): endomycorrhizae, in which the fungal hyphae
penetrate the outer cells of the plant root, forming coils, swellings, and minute branches, and also
extend out into surrounding soil; and ectomycorrhizae, in which the hyphae surround and extend
between the cells but do not penetrate the cell walls of the roots. These are mostly formed with
pines, irs etc. However, the mycelium extends far out into the soil in both kinds of mycorrhizae.
Fig 8.4 Endomycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae. (a) In endomycorrhiza (left side of igure), fungal hyphae penetrate and branch out
in a root cells. In ectomycorrhiza (right side of igure), fungal hyphae simply grow around but do not penetrate the root cell (b)
Ectomycorrhizae on roots of pines.
Fungi grow best in moist habitats, but are found wherever organic matter is present. They survive
dry conditions in some resting stage or by producting resistant spores. They can also tolerate a
wide range of pH from 2 - 9, a wide temperature range, and high osmotic pressure such as in
concentrated salt/sugar solutions as in jelly, jam etc. These features also help them in their survival
on land. Fungi store surplus food usually as lipid droplets or glycogen in the mycelium.

V: 1.1
REPRODUCTION
Most fungi can reproduce asexually as well as sexually (except imperfect fungi in which sexual
reproduction has not been observed).
Asexual reproduction
Asexual reproduction takes place by spores, conidia, fragmentation, and budding. Spores are
produced inside the reproductive structures called sporangia, which are cut of from the hyphae
by complete septa. Spores may be produced by sexual or asexual process, are haploid, non-motile
and not needing water for their dispersal, are small, produced in very large number and dispersed
by wind to great distances and cause wide distribution of many kinds of fungi, including many plant
pathogens. When spores land in a suitable place, they germinate, giving rise to new fungal hyphae.
Spores may also be dispersed by insects and other small animals and by rain splashes. Spores are
a common means of reproduction in fungi.
Conidia (singular conidium) are non- motile, asexual spores which are cut of at the end of modiied
hyphae called conidiophores, and not inside the sporangia, usually in chains or clusters. These
may be produced in a very large number, can survive for weeks and cause rapid colonization of
new food.
Fragmentation is simple breaking of mycelium of some hyphal fungi, each broken fragment giving
rise to a new mycelium.

Unicellular yeasts reproduce by budding (an asymmetric division in which tiny outgrowth or bud is
produced which may separate and grow (Fig 8.7), or by simple, relatively equal cell division.
Fig. 8.7 Micrograph shows yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in various stages of budding.
Sexual Reproduction
Details of sexual reproduction vary in diferent groups of fungi but fusion of haploid nuclei and
meiosis are common to all. When fungi reproduce sexually, hyphae of two genetically diferent but
compatible mating types come together, their cytoplasm fuse followed by nuclear fusion. In two of
the three main groups of fungi (Basidiomycetes, Ascomycetes), fusion of nuclei (karyogamy) does
not take place immediately after the fusion of cytoplasm (plasmogamy); instead the two genetic
types of haploid nuclei from two individuals may coexist and divide in the same hyphae for most
of the life of the fungus. Such a fungal hypha/cell having 2 nuclei of diferent genetic types is called
dikaryotic (also heterokaryotic) hypha/cell (Fig. 8.1).
Diferent groups of fungi produce diferent types of haploid sexual spores, such as basidiospores
and ascospores, subsequent upon meiosis in zygote. These spores may be produced by their
characteristic structure/fruiting bodies such as basidia/basidiocarps and asci/ascocarps.

CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGI
Classiication of fungi into four main groups is based primarily on the type of their sexual
reproductive structures and methods of reproduction. However, these groups also difer in the
type of hyphae and some other characters (Table 8.1).

Zygomycota (Zygomycetes or Conjugating Fungi)
During their sexual reproduction, zygote formed directly by the fusion of hyphae forms temporary,
dormant, thick walled resistant structure called zygospore, hence the name Zygomycetes. Meiosis
takes place when zygospore germinates and haploid spores are produced. Spores on germination
produce new mycelium. Asexual reproduction by spores is common. Hyphae are coenocytic.
Example: Rhizopus, found growing on spoiling moist bread, fruit etc.

resting zygospore.
Ascomycota (Ascomycetes or Sac - Fungi)
It is the largest group of fungi, including over 60,000 species, 50% or so occurring in lichens and
some, such as morels, are mycorrhizal. Most are terrestrial, though some are marine or fresh water.
The group shows diversity from unicellular yeasts to large cup fungi and morels. They produce
haploid sexual spores called ascospores by meiosis inside their characteristic sac like structures
called asci (sing.ascus). Meiosis follows nuclear fusion inside the ascus, commonly 8 ascospores
are produced inside each ascus. Most sac-fungi have asci inside macroscopic fruiting bodies called
ascocarps-the visible morels etc. Their hyphae are septate. They have lengthy dikaryotic phase
that forms ascocarps. They reproduce asexually by conidia that are often dispersed by wind.
Yeasts are unicellular microscopic fungi, derived from all the three diferent groups of fungi but
mostly Ascomycetes, and reproducing mostly asexually by budding (Fig. 8.7).
12
8. Fungi The Kingdom of Recyclers eLearn.Punjab

However yeasts reproduce sexually by forming asci/ascospores or basidia/basidiospores.
They ferment carbohydrate (glucose) to ethanol and carbondioxide. Because of this
feature and many other reasons, these are of great economic importance (see economic
importance of fungi). Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most commonly exploited yeast.

V: 1.1
Basidiomycota (Basidiomycetes or Club - Fungi)
These are among the most familiar fungi; edible mushrooms, devastating plant pathogens rusts
and smuts, pufballs, and bracket/shelf fungi are all club fungi. Basidiomycetes are named so for
their characteristics, club-shaped (hence also called club fungi) sexual reproductive structure, the
basidium (plural basidia). Nuclear fusion in the basidium is followed by meiosis.
Fig. 8.10 Basidiomycetes. A mushroom’s fruiting structures. The gills on underside of mushroom’s cap are lined with basidia, on which
basidiospores are produced.
Four haploid sexual spores, called the basidiospores,
are born on, not inside, each basidium. During most
part of their life cycle the hyphae are septate; the cells
are uninucleate during one phase, and binucleate
(dikaryotic) during the remaining, lengthy phase. Their
characteristic fruiting bodies, or visible mushrooms,
are formed entirely of dikaryotic mycelium. Puccinia
species are most common rust fungi, and Ustilago
species most common smut fungi.
Rusts are called so because of numerous
rusty, orange-yellow coloured disease
spots on their host surface (mostly stem,
leaves), later revealing brick/rust-red
spores of the fungus. Smuts are called
so because of their black, dusty spore
masses that resemble soot or smut;
these spore masses replace the grain
kernels such as those of wheat, corn etc.
(Fig. 8.11, 8.15)

Spores (teliospores) of Ustilago tritici (loose smut of wheat) are carried by wind from infected wheat
ears to healthy lowers, where they germinate. The resulting hyphae penetrate lower ovaries.
Inside the ovary mycelium spreads and becomes dormant and remains so in the seed (grain). When
such infected seeds are sown next season, the hyphae also grow within the growing plant and form
smut spores inside the kernel, thus destroying them completely. The covering of the grain breaks
exposing the black spores mass, that may be dispersed by wind (Fig. 8.11)

V: 1.1
Deuteromycota (Deuteromycetes or Imperfect Fungi)
This heterogenous group includes all such fungi in which sexual phase has not been observed.
Most of them are related to their sexually reproducing relatives of Ascomycetes; however some
are related to other two phyla (Zygomycota, Basidiomycota) as well. If sexual structures are found
on an imperfect fungus, it is then reassigned to the appropriate phylum. Biologists now can classify
most imperfect fungi on the basis of DNA sequences, though sexual structures may not be found.
Penicillium (blue, green molds), Aspergillus (brown molds), Alternaria, Fusarium, Helminthosporium
are some of the economically important genera of Deuteromycetes (see economic importance of
fungi).
Penicillium sp. (blue, green molds) are wide spread saprotrophic species common on decaying
fruit, bread etc. Its hyphae are septate. Penicillium reproduces asexually by means of naked spores
called conidia. These are found in chains at the tips
of special hyphae called conidiophores, which are
branched. Brush-like arrangement of its conidia is
characteristic of Penicillium (Fig. 8.12). These conidia
give colour to the mycelial colony, which is circular.
Mature conidia are easily and readily dispersed.
Despite absence of sexual reproduction, imperfect fungi
show special kind of genetic recombination, called
parasexuality, in which portions of chromosomes of
two nuclei lying in the same hypha are exchanged.

LAND ADAPTATIONS OF FUNGI
Fungi; although grow best in moist habitats, are found wherever organic matter is present. They are
a successful group of land organisms, and posses several features in their body and reproduction
that adapt them to their habit and terrestrial mode of life.
Extensive system of fast-spreading hyphae penetrate the substrate and enormously increase the
contact and surface area for absorption. Cytoplasmic low throughout the hyphae is responsible for
their rapid growth and spread. Chitin in their thickened hyphal wall is more resistant to decay than
are cellulose and lignin found in plant cell wall. They can even break down the lignin (in addition to
17
8. Fungi The Kingdom of Recyclers eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
cellulose) to obtain their nutrients. In saprobes, certain modiied hyphae called rhizoids anchor the
fungus to the substrate and also digest and then absorb the food.
They are very well adapted to live on land due to lack of lagellated cells, nonmotile spores and
conidia eicient dispersal by wind, thick-walled zygote and other resistant structures. Hyphae may
be modiied in such a way as to enable them to reproduce themselves without dependence on
external water.
Many fungi are more tolerant than are bacteria to damage in hyperosmotic surroundings. Many
can tolerate temperature extremes - 5°C below freezing and 50°C or more. Now you can tell why
molds (e.g. Penicillium) can grow on oranges and jelly kept in a refrigerator, while generally bacteria
cannot.
IMPORTANCE OF FUNGI
Ecological Importance
Fungi have great ecological impact. They are very important as decomposers and symbionts. Fungi,
along with saprobic bacteria, play vital role in the recycling of inorganic nutrients in the ecosystem.
Without their activity all the essential nutrients would soon become locked up in the mounds of
dead animals, plants, would be unavailable for use by organisms, and life would cease. Mycorrhizal
fungi improve the growth of plants with which they are associated. 95% of all kinds of vascular
plants have this association.
Lichens growing on rocks break them, setting stage for other organisms during the course of
ecological succession. Lichens are very good bioindicators of air quality as they are very sensitive
to pollution. Some fungi are also used for bioremediation (degrading/removing environmental
poisons/pollutants by organisms).
Commercial Importance
Fungi cause economic gains as well as losses.
Economic gains due to fungi
1. Certain fungi are edible. About 200 species of mushrooms (e.g. Agaricus sp), morels (e.g. Morchella
esculenta), trules (underground fruiting bodies of some

Ascomycetes, e.g. Tuber sp) are common edible fungi. Beware of poisonous mushrooms called the
toadstools, such as death cap/death angel (Amanita) and jack-O’ latem mushroom (Fig. 8.14).
Fig. 8.14 a: Poisonous mushroom Jack-O’ lantern (Omphalotus olearius) whose gills glow in the dark, b: Amanita, another common
poisonous mushroom.
Reindeer moss (a lichen, not a moss) is used as food for reindeers and some other large animals in
arctic/subarctic/boreal regions.
2. Certain fungi are used in food industry. Because of their fermenting ability, yeasts (Saccharomyces
cerevisiae) are used in the production of bread and liquor. Penicillium species are used for giving
lavour, aroma and characteristic colour to some cheese. Some species of Aspergillus are used for
19
8. Fungi The Kingdom of Recyclers eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
fermenting/producing soya sauce and soya paste from soya bean. Citric acid is also obtained from
some Aspergillus species.
3. Some fungi are source of antibiotics and some other drugs. Penicillin, irst antibiotic to be
ever discovered (by A. Fleming-1928) is obtained from Penicillium notatum. Lovastatin is used for
lowering blood cholestrol; cyclosporine obtained from a soil fungus is used in organ transplantation
forpreventing transplant rejection; and ergotine to relieve one kind of headache migraine.
Griseofulvin is used to inhibit fungal growth.
4. Some natural dyes obtained from lichens are used in textile industry.
5. Yeasts are heavily used in genetic/molecular biological research because of their rapid
generation and rapidly increasing pool of genetic and biochemical information. Yeast were the irst
eukaryotes to be used by genetic engineers. In 1983, a functional artiicial chromosome was made
in Saccharomyces cervisiae. The same yeast was the irst eukaryote whose genomic sequence was
completely studied in 1996. Yeasts are also being investigated for production of some hormones.
Pink bread mold Neurospora has also been used for genetic research.
Economic losses due to Fungi
1. Fungi are responsible for many serious plant diseases because they produce several enzymes
that can breakdown cellulose, lignin and even cutin. All plants are susceptible to them. Extensive
damages due to rusts and smut diseases of wheat, com (Fig. 8.15) and rice prompted mass
displacement, and starvation to death of many people.
Powdery mildews (on grapes, rose, wheat etc), ergot of rye, red rot of sugar cane, Potato wilt,
cotton root rot, apple scab, and brown rot of peaches, plums, apricots and cherries are some
other common plant diseases caused by fungi.
2. Fungi also cause certain animal diseases. Ringworm and athlete’s foot are supericial fungal
infections caused by certain imperfect fungi. Candida albicans, a yeast, causes oral and vaginal
thrush (Candidasis or candidosis). Histoplasmosis is a serious infection of lungs caused by inhaling
spores of a fungus which is common in soil contaminated with bird’s feces. If infection spreads into
blood stream and then to other organs (which is very occassional), it can be serious and even fatal.
Aspergillus fumigatus causes aspergillosis, but only in persons with defective immune system such
as AIDS, and may cause death. Some strains of Aspergillus produce one of the most carcinogenic
20
8. Fungi The Kingdom of Recyclers eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
(cancer-causing) mycotoxins (toxins produced
by fungi), called alatoxins. Aspergillus
contaminates improperlystored grains such
as peanuts and com etc. Milk, eggs and meat
may also have small traces of alatoxins.
Any moldy human food or animal forage
product should be discarded. Ergotism is
caused by eating bread made from purple
ergot-contaminated rye lour. The poisonous
material in the ergot causes nervous spasm,
convulsion, Psychotic delusion and even
gangrene.
3. Saprobic fungi are not only useful recyclers
but also cause incalculable damage to food,
wood, iber, and leather by decomposing
them. 15-50% of world’s fruit is lost each
year due to fungal attack. Wood-rotting fungi
destroy not only living trees but also structural
timber. Bracket/ shelf fungi (Fig. 8.16) cause
lot of damage to stored cut lumber as well as
stands of timber of living trees.

During the past few decades biologists have been trying to classify living organisms into various
groups which could logically relect their similarities and dissimilarities at various levels. The groups
were supposed to foreshadow the natural relationships among living organisms and their mode of
origin. Such a system of classiication is called Phylogenetic System of Classiication.
Kingdom Plantae mainly includes eukaryotic, autotrophic, multicellular, non motile organisms
which develop from embryos. Plant cells have cell wall outer to cell membrane which is composed
of cellulose. There are about 360,000 known species of plants.
CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTAE
For the sake of convenience organisms included in Plantae can be divided into two broad categories
viz. non vascular (Bryophyta) and vascular (Tracheophyta) plants. Although this grouping is not
according to any speciic system of classiication but it does relect similarities and dissimilarities
among various groups of plants. Each category (division) is divided into Sub-divisions, Classes, Subclasses and other taxonomic ranks. Detailed discussion of classiication of Plantae will be beyond
the scope of this book. Following is a brief outline of classiication of Plantae.

DIVISION BRYOPHYTA
The irst plants to colonize land were the bryophytes. They are
generally thought to have evolved from green algae.
The Bryophytes are poorly adapted to live on land and are mainly
conined to damp shady places (Fig. 9.1).
These plants are devoid of specialized conducting (xylem and
phloem) and strengthening tissues. Only the process of difusion
and osmosis helps in the transportation of water and minerals as
well as in transportation of prepared food and other substances.
The plant body is with a proper cuticle, or has a very thin one.
The water is absorbed by the general surface of the plant. The
bryophytes are said to be the amphibians of the plant world
because they cannot live away from water. They need water for
reproduction (Fig. 9.2).
The bryophytes are non- vascular
lowerless plants. These plants show a
regular alternation of heteromorphic
(morphologically diferent) generations.
They have a dominant independent free
living gametophyte. This may be thalloid
as in many liverworts or is diferentiated
into structures resembling to stem,
leaves and absorbing and anchoring
organs, rhizoids, as in mosses and some
liverworts. The gametophyte produces a
sporophyte, which is a less conspicuous
generation, partially or totally dependent
upon the gametophyte for its nutrition.
The sporophyte generally consists of foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte is diploid (2n) which
produces in sporangia one kind of haploid spores (i.e. it is homosporous) by meiosis.
4
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1

The spores germinate and give
rise to gametophyte which is also
haploid. Multicellular male and
female sex organs i.e. antheridia
and archegonia respectively, are
born on gametophyte either on same
or diferent plants. These sex organs
are multicellular and protected by a
sterile covering of cells (Fig. 9.3).
Gametes are produced by mitosis.
Male gametes produced within
antheridia are called antherozoids;
antherozoids are motile and always
produced in large number. Female
gametes formed within archegonia
are termed as eggs. A single egg
is formed in each archegonium.
Fertilization takes place in water.
Antherozoids (n) are attracted
towards archegonia (n) chemotactically. A single antherozoid fuses with an egg (n) thus accomplishing
fertilization which results in the formation of the diploid zygote (2n). The zygote is retained within the
female sex organ (archegonium) for some time. After a resting period the zygote develops through mitotic
divisions into a diploid embryo. The embryo ultimately develops into a sporophyte which is also diploid.
The entire development of sporophyte thus takes place within the gametophyte plant body. Even
when the sporophyte is fully developed it remains attached to the gametophyte for nourishment
and protection because it does not contain chloroplasts and is unable to perform photosynthesis.
There is an alternation of generations in the life cycle of bryophytes i.e. multicellular haploid
gametophytic (gamete producing) generation alternates with the multicellular diploid sporophytic
(spore producing) generation (Fig. 9.6). It is a very important phenomenon, which provides
continuous genetic variabilities and selection for the best genetic make up for survival and
adaptation in the changing environment(s) (as explained in a later section).
In view of the above mentioned discussion, bryophytes can therefore be deined more precisely as
plants with the distinguishing characters as follows :
5
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
 ’’Vascular system absent; gametophyte dominant; sporophyte attached to gametophyte;
homosporous.”

ADAPTATION TO LAND HABITAT
In general bryophytes developed the following adaptive characters for terrestrial environment:
1. Formation of a compact multicellular plant body which helped in the conservation of water by
 reducing cell surface area exposed to dry land conditions. Presence of cuticle further reduces
 loss of water by evaporation.
2. Development of photosynthetic tissues into special chambers for the absorption of carbon
 dioxide without losing much water and exposure to light.
3. Formation of special structures like rhizoids for absorption of water and anchorage.
4. Heterogamy (production of two types of gametes) is evolved, forming non motile egg containing
 stored food and motile sperms.
5. Gametes are produced and protected by the special multicellular organs (antheridia and
 archegonia).
6. Multicellular embryo is formed which is retained and protected inside the female reproductive
 body during its development.
7. Alternation of spore-producing generation (sporophyte) with gamete producing generation
 (gametophyte) enabled the plant to produce and test the best genetic combinations for adapting
 to the versatile terrestrial conditions.
CLASSIFICATION
Bryophytes are divided into three subdivisions : Hepaticopsida, Bryopsida and Anthoceropsida.
6
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Hepaticopsida (Liverworts)
Bryophytes belonging to this subdivision are called liverworts. It includes about 900 species.
Liverworts are the simplest of all bryophytes (Fig. 9.4).
They are usually found on moist rocks and on wet soil. Since they live near water therefore chances
of drying out are greatly reduced.
The plant body is a gametophyte. It may be thalloid i.e. lat, or ribbon-like, usually dichotomously
branched. It is attached to soil by means of rhizoids e.g. Marchantia, Other species tend to grow
upright and are falsely leafy i.e., diferentiated into a false stem, and leaves e.g., Porella (Fig. 9.4b).
The sporophyte is dependent upon gametophyte! for nourishment and protection.
The sex organs develop on the upper surface of the thallus near the tips of the branches.
Sometimes they develop on special branches on gametophyte called the antheridiophores and
the archegoniophores as in Marchantia (Fig. 9.5).

Bryopsida
Like liverworts most mosses inhabit damp
places. In contrast to other bryophytes they grow
equally well in fairly dry places. However, water
is essential in the reproduction of mosses, thus
they usually grow to form cushions or mats.
Each adult moss plant, a gametophyte, is always
diferentiated into structures which resemble
stem and leaves. Multicellular rhizoids are also
present. Examples of mosses are Funaria and
Polytrichum (Fig. 9.7). Archegonia and antheridia,
develop on the tips of diferent branches on the
same plant e.g., Funaria, or on diferent plants
as in Polytrichum. The archegonia and antheridia
form clusters and are mixed with sterile hairs,
the paraphyses.
Formation of diploid sporophyte and haploid
spores follow the same sequence of events of
alternation of generations as in liverworts (Fig.
9.6). However, the spore of a moss, unlike that of
liverworts, develops into an alga like structure, the
protonema. Haploid moss plants (gametophyte)
develop from buds on the protonema and the
life cycle is completed (Fig. 9.8).

V: 1.1
 Fig. 9.8 Moss life cycle
Anthoceropsida (Horn Worts)
This group of bryophytes difers in many respects and is slightly advanced than Bryopsida and
Hepaticopsida. The gametophyte is highly lobed and irregular in outline. Except for a little early
stage of development, the sporophyte is not dependent upon gametophyte for nourishment
and protection. Antheridia and archegonia are partially sunken in the gametophytic tissue.
The sporophyte exhibit many advanced characters due to which it can thrive better on land as
compared to other groups. The sporophyte has stomata and chloroplasts in the epidermis and can
thus photosynthesize its own food rather than obtaining it from gametophyte. It also has a waxy
cuticle to check excessive loss of water (desiccation). Furthermore, at the junction of foot and spore
producing region there is a band of meristematic tissue. This tissue keeps on adding cells towards
the spore-producing region during the formation, maturation and dispersal of spores from the
opposite end. Due to the fast growth rate of this meristematic tissue the sporophyte keeps on
10
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
increasing in length for an indeinite period of time. Due to these characters the sporophyte
continues to survive as such even after the death and decay of the gametophyte. One good example
of Anthoceropsida is Anthoceros which is also found in the hilly areas of Pakistan (Fig. 9.9)
Fig. 9.9 Anthoceros, a hornwort (a) Gametophyte with attached horn-shaped sporophyte (b) V.S. of sporophyte.
Alternation of generations
In the life history of liverworts, mosses and hornworts there are two distinct multicellular phases
or generations. These generations are haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte, which
regularly alternate with each other. The gametophyte is the dominant generation because it is more
conspicuous. It produces gametes called spermatozoids or antherozoids and eggs, therefore
called gamete-producing generation. A haploid spermatozoid fuses with a haploid egg to produce
diploid oospore.
The oospore does not produce the gametophyte directly but produces a totally diferent plant
called sporophyte. The sporophyte in bryophytes is a less conspicuous generation, which is usually
diferentiated into foot, seta and capsule (also called sporogonium). Spores develop within the
capsule by reduction division (meiosis) from spore mother cells. The sporophyte produces spores
and is, therefore, called spore producing generation. The spore on germination does not develop
11
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
into a sporophyte but gives rise to the gametophyte. Thus in the life-history of a bryophytic plant,
the two generations, the gametophyte and the sporophyte, regularly alternate with each other. The
phenomenon of alternation of gametophyte and sporophyte in the life history of a plant is called
alternation of generations (Fig. 9.10).
It should be noted that the gametophyte or haploid stage begins with spores and ends at gametes,
whereas the sporophyte begins with oospore and ends at spore mother cell.
The signiicance of alternation of generations
During the formation of spores from spore mother cells by meiotic division reshuling of genes
occurs. As a consequence, a great variety of spores with diferent genetic make-up are produced.
These spores in turn produce gametophytes with diferent genetic combinations. The gametophytes
with better genetic make-up will have a better chance for survival in the environment where
they occur. On the other hand, the gametophytes with less advantageous characteristics will be
eliminated. There is no reshuling of genes during gametogenesis in the gametophyte as gametes
are produced after mitosis.
The oospore developing after fertilization now has a new genetic make-up as compared to the
12
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1

parent. This genetic variation passes to the new sporophyte which on maturity once again produces
further genetic recombination which are transferred to the gametophyte. In this natural process
the sporophyte thus provide a large amount of genetic variability and nature selects the best
genetic combinations. In the long run, this will allow the populations to become increasingly better
adapted to their environment.
DIVISION TRACHEOPHYTA
Tracheophytes are called vascular plants because of the presence of vascular tissues i.e. xylem and
phloem.These are the successful group of land plants. They are able to adapt the rough land habitat
most successfully and amongst them the lowering plants today have dominated land habitat. The
evolution of following complex vegetative and reproductive characteristics enabled the vascular
plants in general and lowering plants speciically to become predominant lora of land :
1. Root, stem and leaves.
2. Vascular systems in stems, roots and leaves.
3. Protected sporangia, leading to the evolution of seed.
4. Pollen tube for safe and water-independent transmission of male gamete to female gamete.
5. Flower and fruit.
6. Heteromorphic alternation of generation.
The Tracheophytes are further sub-divided into four sub-divisions, Psilopsida, Lycopsida,
Sphenopsida and Prteropsida.
PSILOPSIDA (PSILOPHYTA)
In Psilopsida plants have rootless sporophytes. The stem is diferentiated into an underground
rhizome and an aerial part. Both are dichotomously branched. The rhizome bears rhizoids,
both perform the function of root. The aerial branches are green, lealess and bear small veinless
outgrowths and carry out photosynthesis. The reproductive organs of sporophyte are sporangia
which develop at the tips of long or short branches, or on lateral sides of branches (Fig. 9.11).
13
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Internal structure of stem is simple. Vascular tissue is narrow, central and soild without pith, with
a broad cortex.
Psilopsida is considered to be the earliest group of vascular plants. Most of the representatives of
this group have become extinct, for example, Horneophyton, Psilophyton, Cooksonia (Fig. 9.11)
etc.
Fig. 9.11 Psilotum
(a) Dichotomously lealess branches.
(b) The erect branches of another species, showing brown sporangia.
There are only two living genera Psilotum, and Tmesipeteris.
The gametophyte is thalloid. It is colorless and underground. Its cells contain a fungus which
provides food to the gametophyte and in return gets protection from it. Such beneicial symbiotic
relationship among the two members (fungus and plant) is said to be symbiosis; or mycorrhizal
association. Examples are Psilotum, and Tmesipeteris.
EVOLUTION OF LEAF
Early vascular land plants did not have true leaves or roots. They were small in size, with
14
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
dichotomously branched erect smooth aerial parts and equally strong subterranean anchoring
and absorptive rhizome.


Fig. 9.12 Cooksonia : an early vascular plant bearing sporangia at the tips of the branches.
Cooksonia (Fig. 9.12) had the same structural layout
i.e. naked stem without leaves. Such plants started
to form leaves as small scale like out growths.
These out growths were not supplied with vascular
tissues, therefore they were not regarded as true
leaves. Lycopods were the irst plants that formed
the true leaves and roots.
However in lycopods (e.g. Lycopodium) the leaves
are small in size. Each leaf has a single undivided
vein (vascular supply). Such a leaf is called
microphyll.
Large leaves having divided veins and veinlets
with an expanded leaf blade or lamina are known as megaphylls. Megaphylls are characteristic
for ferns and seed plants. It is suggested that evolution of megaphylls started from a dichotomous
branching system in some primitive psilopsids approximately 350 million years ago. It is assumed
that evolution of a megaphyll included series of successive evolutionary steps (Fig. 9.13) which are
as follows :
Fig. 9.13 Successive evolutionary steps in the evolution of leaf.
15
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1

Overtopping
The dichotomously branched aerial portion of the stem showed unequal branching. Some branches
remained short while others grew and expanded at a much faster pace. All these branches grew in
diferent planes. Such an unequal development of various branches is called overtopping.
Planation
Next important step was the arrangement of unequal dichotomies in one plane. This process is
termed as planation.
Fusion/Webbing
Overtopping and planation was followed by a process known as fusion or webbing. The space
between the overtopped dichotomous branches was occupied by a sheet of parenchyma cells
which connected these branches forming a lat lamina or leaf blade type of structure, having many
dichotomously branched veins (Fig. 9.13).
During the course of evolution fusion of the vascular strands resulted in net or reticulate venation
pattern. The process of evolution of leaf was very slow and gradual which completed in more than
15-20 million years.
LYCOPSIDA
The plants of Lycopsida have sporophytes diferentiated into roots, stem and true leaves. The
leaves are small and single- veined, they are also called microphylls. The arrangement of leaves is
spiral or opposite. The sporangia develop singly on the upper side of the sporophylls, which may
or may not be arranged to form strobili (Fig. 9.14)
The sporophyte may have sporangia of one kind as in Lycopodium or of two kinds i.e., microsporangia
and megasporangia as in Selaginella (Fig. 9.15).
16
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Lycopsids are also called club mosses/spike mosses because of their club/spike shaped strobili
and small leaves resembling mosses. On the basis of types of spores produced in the sporophyte
they are thus referred to as being homosporous’ or ‘heterosporous’ respectively. This condition is
called homospory and heterospory. Selaginella resembles seed producing plants (spermatophytes)
because of its heterosporic condition and some other characters. The gametophyte of Lycopsida
is mainly underground.
17
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1

SPHENOPSIDA
In Sphenopsida (Horsetails), the sporophyte is diferentiated into root, stem and leaves. The leaves
may be expanded or scale-like and are always arranged in whorls. Plants belonging to this group are
also called arthrophytes because the whole plant body is composed of large number of joints. Main
stem is not smooth, it has large number of ridges and furrows. Each node has whorl of branches.
The sporangia are born on structures called sporangiophores, aggregated to form strobili.

Each sporangiophore has a slender stalk and an expanded disc at its free end. The sporangia appear
on the underside of the disc. The thalloid gametophytes grow upon clayey soil and on mud, e.g.,
Equisetum (Fig. 9.16).

PTEROPSIDA
Pteropsida is divided into three classes (i) class Filicineae (ii) class Gymno spermae (iii) class
Angiospermae. The class Filicineae contains seedless plants with foliar sporangia (sporangia
attached to fronds Fig. 9.17). The leaves are called fronds. When the frond is immature and young,
it is coiled, this pattern of development is called circinate vernation (Fig. 9.19). It is an important
character of this group.

9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Class Filicineae
The Filicineae or fems are mostly shade and moisture loving plants. A very few are able to live
under dry conditions. They grow on the hills and in plains. Some are epiphytic and grow on the bark
of trees. Although ferns are worldwide in distribution, they are especially abundant in the tropics.
They vary greatly in size. Important ferns are Dryopteris, Pteridium, Adiantum and Pteris etc.
Adiantum (Maiden-hairfern)
Adiantum is a fem that grows along moist walls and water courses. It is a small herb consisting of
stem, roots and leaves. Stem is a short, thick and underground, usually unbranched horizontally
growing rhizome. The rhizome is protected by brownish scales (ramenta) and covered by persistent
leaf basis. Fibrous adventitions roots arise from the lower side of the rhizome. Large, pinnately
compound fronds arise from the upper side of rhizome. Young leaves (iddle heads) show circinate
vernation. The stipe (stalk) and rachis are black, smooth, shiny (hence called maiden hair fem).
The lealets (pinnae, and pinnules - lealets of second order) show dichotomous venation. Sori
(groups of sporangia) are born on the underside of relexed lobes of the margins of lealets, and
are protected by bent margin of the lealet, forming false indusium.
Life Cycle : Life cycle of Adiantum shows hetromorphic alternation of generation, sporophyte
being dominant and gametophyte small and reduced but separate and independent. The diploid
sporophyte produce large number of sori (singular-sorus).They are green, but when ripe they
become dark brown. Each sorus consists of a number of sporangia covered by false indusium. The
leaves bearing sporangia are called sporophylls.
Each sporangium is slightly lattened, biconvex body (capsule) born on a multicellular stalk. The
capsular wall consists of a single layer of lat, thin walled cells. The edge of the capsule is made up
of two parts, the annulus and the stomium. The annulus occupies three fourth of the edge and
remaining one fourth is the stomium. Annular cells have their radial and inner walls thickened.
The stomial cells are thin- walled. Inside the sporangia, haploid spores are formed by reduction
division, from diploid spore mother cells. The annulus of the sporangium contracts in dry weather,
the stomial cells being thin-walled rupture and spores are dispersed by wind.
When a spore falls on a moist soil, it germinates at a suitable temperature and produces a haploid
gametophyte or prothallus.

The prothallus (gametophyte) is an autotrophic, small, lat, heart shaped structure. At the anterior
end of the prothallus is a notch in which lies the growing point. Its size is about 8mm at its longest
diameter. It is horizontally placed on the soil, and has unicellular rhizoids on its lower surface
towards the posterior end. The rhizoids ix the prothallus to the soil and absorb nutrients for it. It
is composed of rounded thin walled cells. The margin of the prothallus is one-celled thick but the
middle part is many-celled and is cushion-like.
The prothallus is monoecious i.e., male and female sex organs appear on the under-surface of the
same prothallus. In the mature prothallus, archegonia occur near the notch and the antheridia are
scattered among the rhizoids.
Each antheridium produces numerous spermatozoids which are spirally coiled andmulticiliated..

The arcnegonium consists of a venter and a neck. The venter contains the egg or oosphere and is
embedded in the cushion of the thallus. The antherozoids reach the archegonium, by swimming
in water, Fertilization occurs and an oospore is formed. The oospore forms the sporophyte. Young
sporophyte is irst attached to the gametophyte but later becomes independent. The life history of
this fern is shown in Fig 9.19.
EVOLUTION OF SEED HABIT
A review of the kingdom Plantae indicates that the seed-plants (spermatophytes) predominate
over non-seed vascular plants.
One of the most signiicant events in the history of land plants’ was the development of seed
habit. It was an important change in the reproductive system of the vascular plants which occurred
approximately 390 million years ago. First complete seeds appeared approximately 365 million
years ago during late Devonian times. Technically a seed may be deined as a fertilized ovule. An
ovule is an integumented indehiscent megasporangium. Integuments are specialized protective
coverings around megasporangium which vary in number. All seed producing plants are called
spermatophytes. Various steps involved in the evolution of seed habit are as follows.
1. Evolution of heterospory.
2. Retention and germination of megaspore within the megasporangium.
3. Development of protective layers around megasporangium.
4. Reduction to a single functional megaspore per sporangium.
5. Development of an embryo sac within the sporangium.
6. Modiication of distal end of megasporangium for pollen capture.
1. Evolution of heterospory
Primitive vascular land plants produced one kind of spores, a condition called homospory. All groups
of land plants up to pteridophytes are homosporous. During the early phase of evolution some
plant groups started producing two diferent types of spores, the smaller ones called microspores
and the larger ones known as megaspores.
The microspores produced inside microsporangia germinate to form male gametophyte or the
microgametophyte, whereas the megaspores germinated to form female gametophyte or
22
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
megagametophyte.
2. Retention and germination of megaspore within the megasporangium
During the usual reproductive cycle in the heterosporous vascular land plants, the megaspores
are used to be shed and dispersed soon after their formation in order to germinate into female
gametophyte. However in some plants (e.g. Selaginella) the megaspore is not allowed to escape
from megasporangium immediately after its formation. In others the megaspore is permanently
retained within the megasporangium. Here, within the conines of the megasporangium wall the
megaspore germinates to form egg containing female gametophyte.
3. Development of protective layers around megasporangium
Some branch like structures of sporophyte surrounding the megasporangium fused around to
megasporangium to form protective envelope or integument. The megasporangium tightly locked
by integuments becomes totally indehiscent. This important change led to the evolution and
formation of the ovule, which is nothing but an integumented indehiscent megasporangium. In
this way more protection is accorded to the egg-containing apparatus in terrestrial environment.
4. Reduction to a single functional megaspore per sporangium
Each megaspore mother cell within a megasporangium used to produce four gametophytes. There
was a competition for space and food among the four gametophytes. Soon the early vascular
plants adopted a new strategy i.e., only one megaspore is selected for further development into a
healthy female gametophyte while the remaining three are aborted.
5. Development of an embryo sac within the sporangium
The single healthy megaspore retained within the megasporangium germinates to form an egg
containing female gametophyte called an embryo sac.
6. Modiication of distal end of megasporangium for pollen capture
When most of the structural and functional changes leading to the development of seed habit were
completed, another important modiication took place in the megasporangium which was now
integumented, indehiscent and permanently attached to - the sporophyte. The distal end of the
megasporangium became modiied for capturing pollen (microspore containing male gametophyte).
Pollen after being trapped in the distal cavity of the megasporangium produces pollen tube which
carry male gametes deep into the embryo sac to fertilize the egg, forming a zygote, that forms an
embryo. The megasporangium (ovule) after fertilization is transformed into a seed, the integuments
23

becoming the seed coats.. The seed ofers maximum degree of protection to a developing embryo
under the unfavorable terrestrial environment. The development and evolution of seed habit was
a great success and a giant leap which ultimately enabled Plants to colonize land permanently.
Class Gymnospermae
Gymnosperms are one of the successful groups of seed plants of worldwide distribution They
constitute about one-third of the world’s forests. The gymnosperms are heterosporous plants which
produce seeds but no fruits. The term gymnospermae literally means ‘naked seeded’ (Gymno=
naked, spermae= seed). The ovules in these plants are usually borne on the exposed surfaces of
fertile leaves (megasporophylls). These ovules, unlike those of angiosperms are not enclosed but
lie naked on the surface of fertile leaves.
Like Filicinae, they show regular heteromorphic alternation of generations. They have independent,
dominant sporophyte but less conspicuous, dependent gametophyte. The female gametophyte is
permanently retained within the ovule. The two kinds of spores are microspores and megaspores
which develop on microsporophylls and megasporophylls respectively. The megasporophylls
bearing ovules are not folded and joined at the margins to form an ovary. For this reason the seeds
lie naked on the mega sporophylls, (Fig. 9.20a).
The important genera are Cycas (sago-palm) (Figs. 9.20-a), Pinus (Pine), Taxus (Yew), Picea (Hemlock)
and Cedrus (deodar) Ginkgo (Fig. 9.20-b) etc.

Pinus- Life Cycle
The Pine is a conifer. The main plant body is sporophyte which produces spores after reduction
division of spore mother cell in sporangia. Conifers are heterosporous. Microspores and megaspores
are produced in microsporangia and megasporangia respectively. Sporangia (i.e., micro and
megasporangia) are produced on respective cones (male cones and female cones) on the same
plant.
The male cones are small in size and are produced in clusters on an axis. Each male cone consists
of microsporophylls which contain microsporangia. Microspore germinates to form a small
inconspicuous male gametophyte (also called as microgametophyte) within the spore wall. Such a
microspore of seed plants that contains the microgametophyte including the gametes is called a
pollen grain (Plural = pollen).
Pollen are produced in great numbers and are transported by wind. Pollen grain in Pinus has
two wings attached to its lateral sides. Due to wings, pollen can loat in air for a longer period of
time and ean travel long distances. The gymnosperms have successfully evolved this totally new
mechanism of transfer of male gamete to the female gametophyte through wind which has made
them independent of water for this purpose. This is an important improvement and evolutionary
adaptation to survive in the harsh dry terrestrial (land) environment.
The female cones are large and conspicuous. Each female cone is composed of large number of
spirally arranged scales, the megasporophylls which are woody in texture. At the base of each
scale two ovules are present. An ovule is actually a megasporangium which is protected by an
integument. Each megasporangium has a single diploid megaspore mother cell. The megaspore
mother cell divides meiotically to produce four haploid megaspores. The functional megaspore (n)
undergoes mitosis to produce female gametophyte or an embryo sac. The embryo sac contains
one to several archegonia. The archegonia contain the female gamete or an egg.
During pollination the pollen land directly on the ovules. Only few pollen are able to germinate to
form pollen tubes through which male gametes are transferred to the embryo sac for fertilization.
More then one egg can be fertilized to form several zygotes, but one zygote usually survives to form
a single embryo. After fertilization the ovule becomes the seed. The seeds now contains an embryo
along with some stored food material. The seed upon germination gives rise to a new sporophyte
plant.
In the life cycle of Piuns, the dominant diploid sporophyte generation alternates with inconspicuous

haploid gametophyte generation (Fig. 9.21).
Fig.9.21 Life Cycle of Pinus
Class Angiospermae
The term angiosperms literally means “enclosed seeded” (Angio=close Sperm = seed). In these
plants fertile leaves bearing ovules are folded and joined at the margins to form ovaries. The ovary
after fertilization is changed into a fruit, containing seeds.
Angiosperms make up 235,000 of the 360,000 known species of plants. They are heterosporous,
autotrophic plants. These are highly evolved of all the plants on the earth. The plants produce
lowers, fruits and seeds.

Fig. 9.22 Some of the remarkable diversity of angiosperms is shown in these photographs. The species shown here are Dicots (a)
Fragrant water lily, (b) wild geranium, (c) Indian pipe (a parasite) an angiosperm that lacks chlorophyll.
Life Cycle of an angiospemic plant
The adult plant is a diploid sporophyte mostly diferentiated into roots, stem and leaves. At maturity
it produces lowers. A lower is a modiied shoot which consists of a pedicel, thalamus or torus, and
loral leaves (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels). Thalamus and loral leaves, especially the stamens
and the carpels, are so modiied, that they do not even look like stem and leaves respectively. The
sepals and petals are non- essential or non-reproductive parts, and stamens and carpels are the
essential or reproductive parts of the lower.
The sepals and the petals protect the stamens and the carpels. They also attract insects for
pollination. When the pollination is over, the sepals usually and the petals always fall of.
The anther contain microspore mother cells which produce haploid microspores through meiosis.
Each microspore germinates to produce male gametophyte. Such microspores containing male
gametophytes are called pollen.
The carpel consists of a basal broader part, the ovary, the style and the terminal part of the style,
the stigma. The ovary contains ovules. The ovule consists of an integument (covering) and a tissue,
the nucellus present inside.
After pollination, the pollen grain is transferred to the stigma. Here it germinates to form a pollen
tube. The nucleus of the microspore divides by mitotic divisions to form two male gametes and
the tube nucleus. At this stage of development, the pollen grain is called male gametophyte. In the
meantime certain changes occur in the ovule leading to the formation of female spore (megaspore).
The megaspore develops into female gametophyte. This consists of seven cells only. One of these
27
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
cells is the egg or oosphere.
 The pollen tube grows through the style, enters the ovule and then reaches the female gametophyte.
Here it discharges the male gametes. The egg and one of the two male gametes fuse to form the
oospore. The second male gamete fuses with the secondary nucleus to form endosperm nucleus
(double fertilization). The oospore develops into an embryo and endosperm nucleus develops
into a multicellular nutritive tissue, the endosperm.

Seed Formation
Meanwhile, the integuments of the ovule form testa and tegmen and ovary wall develops into the
fruit. Seeds usually undergo a period of rest and then under suitable conditions, germinate and
produce a seedling which gradually changes into a sporophyte (Fig. 9.23).
Thus an alternation of dominant sporophyte generation(2n) occurs with inconspicuous
gametophyte generation(n).
Fig. 9.23 Life Cycle of on angiospermic plants
Double Fertilization
Double fertilization is a special process found in Angiosperms. In this two male gametes fuses with
two cells simultaneously. A male gamete (n) fuses with egg (n) to form a diploid zygote (2n) which
develops later into an embryo and second male gamete (n) fuses with another female cell called
fusion nucleus (2n) resulting into a triploid (3n) endosperm cell, which develops into food storing
29
9. Kingdom Plantae eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
endosperm tissue. It is an important evolutionary advancement in which food storage in fertilized
ovule is made only on fertilization i.e. formation of zygote. This actually helps the plant to economize
its food resources.
Classiication of Angiosperms
The class Angiospermae is divided into two sub-classes, the Monocotyledonae (with one cotyledon)
and the Dicotyledonae (with two cotyledons), according to the number of cotyledons in the embryo.
The plants included in the Monocotyledonae are called Monocotyledonous plants or Monocots.
The plants included in the Dicotyledonae are called Dicotyledonous plants or Dicots. A few
distinguishing characters of the two classes are given below:

Distributed throughout the world wherever vascular plants can survive. It includes about 600
genera, 10,000 species. In Pakistan it is represented by 158 genera and 492 species.
The traditional family name Gramineae takes its name from the Latin Grammar which was used as a
‘generic’ name for certain grasses, is permitted by the International Code of Binomial Nomenclature,
which also provides for the use of Poaceae, based upon the type genus Poa Linn.
Familiar Plants: Triticum vulgare, Wheat; Zea mays, Com; Avena sativa, Oats; Oryza sativa, Rice;
Bambusa, Bamboo; Saccharam oicinarum Sugar Cane etc.

internodes, closed at the nodes. Leaves: Solitary at the nodes, sometimes crowded at the base of
the stem, alternate, exstipulate, ligulate, mostly sessile, leaf-base mostly sheathing, simple.
Inlorescence: Mostly compound composed of units called spikelets which are variously arranged
(indense clusters as in wheat, compound spike, or loosely on branched axis-as in oats , spikelets
consisting of bracts, arranged along a slender axis (called rachilla) the two lower bracts (called
glumes) which are empty; the succeeding lemmas enclosing a lower and opposed by a hyaline
scale called palea. The Whole (lemma, palea, and lower) termed as loret; the glumes or lemmas
often bearing one or more stif bristles (called awns); this basic pattern of spikelet structure is

INTRODUCTION
Animalia kingdom includes all the animals. The name animalia is derived from Latin, anima = breath
or soul.
In traditional two-kingdom systems, the multicellular animals were referred to broadly as Metazoa
to distinguish them from one-celled animals, the Protozoa. In this text book we have followed the
ive kingdom classiication system introduced by Robert Whittaker. In this system of classiication
the traditional Protozoa belong to kingdom Protoctista. Kingdom Animalia consists of all animals
which are multicellular, diploid eukaryotic, ingestive heterotrophs and develop from two dissimilar
haploid gametes, a large egg and a smaller sperm. In this chapter we will discuss various groups
and subgroups with details of the phyla in your curriculum.
Virtually all biologists agree that animals evolved from protoctists; however, which protoctists,
when, and in what sort of environments, are questions that are still actively debated.

DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEXITY IN ANIMALS
Although multicellularity is found in all the kingdoms, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia but it has
developed most impressively in animals- their cells are joined by complex junctions, this ensures
control of communications and low of materials between cells. The animals are a diverse group
distinct in their form. The smallest are microscopic, which are smaller than many protoctists and
the largest today are whalessea mammals, included in phylum Chordata.
The simplest of the animals belong to subkingdom Parazoa (phylum Porifera). These animals lack
tissues organised into organs and have indeterminate shape, and are asymmetrical. The sub kingdom
Eumetazoa includes animals of other phyla. These animals have tissues organised into organs
and organ systems. These include radially symmetrical animals (grade Radiata) and bilaterally
symmetrical animals (grade Bilateria). Grade Radiata includes simplest of the Eumetazoa (phylum
Cnidaria). They are much simpler in their organisation compared to the animals belonging to other
Eumetazoa. Most of the phyla which belong to kingdom Animalia (about 29) belong to subkingdom
Eumetazoa. These animals have been divided into three groups on the basis of presence, absence
or type of body cavity found in them. The animals which do not have a body cavity have been
grouped under Acoelomata. The animals which have a false coelom, the pseudocoele, have been
grouped under Pseudocoelomata. The animals which have a true coelom have been grouped
under Coelomata.
GRADE RADIATA
In this group animals with radial symmetry have been included. All the animals which are included
here are also diploblastic. This is a condition or organization in which the parts of the body are
arranged around a central axis in such a way that any plane passing through the central axis divides
the animal in halves that are almost mirror image of each other e.g. as in cnidaria (coelenterata).
The cylindrical body of a sea-anemone can be cut in two equal halves vertically in any plane.

GRADE BILATERIA
This group includes animals with bilateral symmetry. In an animal where the right side is
approximately the same as the left side and where there is a distinct anterior end is said to have
bilateral symmetry. The animal can be divided into two equal parts by an imaginary line only in one
plane. In most multicellular animals there is a clearly diferentiated head present at the anterior end
and a distinct posterior end. Also there are clearly deined dorsal and ventral surfaces. The animals
belonging to phyla, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata,
Hemichordata and Chordata are included in this grade. It must be mentioned here that the animals
belonging to phylum echinodermata, have developed bilateral symmetry, as is evident, from the
study of structure of their larvae. However, the adult Echinoderms, have secondarily developed
radial symmetry, due to their special mode of life. All the animals included in grade Bilateria are
triploblastic. These may be acoelomate, pseudocoelomate or coelomate.

A spiral and determinate cleavage is that in which the lines or planes of cleavage are not symmetrical
between poles instead these are diagonal to the polar axis and produce unequal cells around the
axis of polarity and all the blastomeres have determined role to play in the formations of embryo.
The fate of each blastomere is foretold.
In radial and indeterminate cleavage the planes of cleavage are symmetrical to the polar axis and
produce tiers of cells on top of each other and the fate of each blastomere is not pre-determined.
In some anyone blastomere can produce a complete embryo.

DIPLOBLASTIC AND TRIPLOBLASTIC ORGANISATION
Diploblastic animals belong to division radiata. The body of these animals consists of two layers
of cells, ectoderm and endoderm. There is a jelly like mesenchyme or mesogloea which in most
cases is non cellular. Diploblastic animals show lesser degree of specialisation and they do not
form specialised organs. There is no special transport system in these animals. Most substances
are distributed within their body by process of difusion. There is no central nervous system in
these animals. A neuron net is present. These animals have radial symmetry. There is only one
cavity in the body called gastrovascular cavity which has only mouth which serves for the entry
of food and water and also for the removal of wastes along with water. This is known as sac like
digestive system. Diploblastic animals are included in phylum Cnidaria (coelenterate) which would
be discussed in detail later in the chapter.
Triploblastic animals are included in phyla which have been placed in grade bilateria/ The body of
these animals is made from three layers ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. After embryonic
development these layers in most triploblastic animals are not distinct as separate layers of cells,
but are represented by the structures formed from them. The cells of these animals show greater
degree of specialisation. These have specialised organs and organs systems. Special transport
systems i.e. blood vascular system is present in most of the cases. The systems such as integumentary
and nervous develop from ectoderm. Mesodem gives rise to muscular, skeletal and reproductive
systems. Endoderm forms the lining of digestive tract and glands of digestive system, such as liver.
The digestive system is of tube type i.e. having mouth at the anterior end and the anus at the
posterior end. Triploblastic animals may be acoelomate, pseudocoelomate or coelomate.
Acoelomates, Pseudocoelomates and Coelomates
The following account would help to explain the above mentioned terms.
Acoelomates
In phylum Platyhelminthes there is no body cavity or coelom, and the mesoderm forms a loose,
cellular tissue called mesenchyma or parenchyma which ills the space between the ectoderm and
endoderm. It forms a packing around the internal organs of the animals to support and protect
them. Such animals are called acoelomates (Fig. 10.3). In acoelomates the gut is sac-type and there
is no special transport system. Only excretory system is developed for the transport of excretory
products. This system consists of lame cells, excretory ducts and excretory pores. However the
nervous system is well developed.
8
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Pseudocoelomates
In Aschelminthes the space between the body wall and the digestive tube is called pseudocoelom
(false body cavity). Pseudocoelom is not homologous to true coelom because: it is not lined by
coelomic epithelium. It has no relation with the reproductive and excretory organs. It develops
from the blastocoel of the embryo and it is bounded externally by the muscles and internally by the
cuticle of the intestine. The animals having pseudocoelom are called pseudocoelomates
Coelomates
Coelom is cavity present between the body wall and the alimentary canal and is lined by mesoderm.
The mesoderm splits into outer parietal layer which under lines the body wall and the visceral
layer which covers the alimentary canal and the cavity between them is the true coelom. It is illed
with luid called coelomic luid. The animals which possess coelom or true body cavity are called
coelomates e.g. animals from annelids to chordates.
In coelomates gut attains more complexity and neuro-sensory system is well developed along with
excretory system, circulatory system, respiratory and reproductive systems.

PARAZOA
Phylum: Porifera the most primitive animals
The name porifera is derived from Latin porus = pore, ferra = to bear
9
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The Porifera are pore-bearing animals, commonly called the sponges. All are aquatic. Out of total
5000 species 150 species live in fresh water while all others are marine.
General Characteristics
These animals are composed of many cells however there is no tissue organization and have
no organs. Sponges lack symmetry. In most sponges the body wall is formed of an outer layer,
pinacoderm, made up of cells called pinacocytes: and an inner layer choanoderm made of lagellated
collar cells called choanocytes. Between these two
layers is present gelatinous mesenchyme which may
contain amoeboid cells and spicules or sponging ibres.
The poriferans range in size from few millimeter wide to more than one metre tall. They are
macroscopic i.e., can be seen with naked eye. There is a single cavity inside the body, the spongocoel.
In most sponges the spongocoel may be divided into lagellated chambers or canals, lined by
lagellated choanocytes.
Numerous pores are present in the body wall. The pores through which water enters the body are
called ostia, and pore by which the water leaves the body is known as osculum (main opening).
There are no respiratory or circulatory organs.
Since the sponges are sessile, therefore these depend upon the food coming to them along with
water currents brought about by movement of lagella of choanocytes. This includes small animals,
(zooplankton) and plants, (phytoplankton) which constitute about 20% of their food. 80% of their
food consists of detrital organic particles. The food enters the spongocoel cavity through Ostia. The
food is ingested by the lagellated cells, the choanocytes. The waste products either difuse out of
the sponge directly through the body wall or low out through osculum.
The adult sponges are stationary, spending their lives attached to the rocks at the bottom or other
solid objects. However, their larvae are able to move (swim).
There is no deinite nervous system, however neurosensory and neuron cells are probably present
which seem to coordinate the low of water.
The skeleton is in the form of variously shaped needle-like structures called spicules. These may be
calcareous or siliceous. The bath sponge has a skeleton of spongin ibres. The skeleton is present
among pinacocytes and provides support. Spicules are also present around osculum and ostia.
Scolymastra joubini- a barrel like glass sponge of
Antarctica is more than a metre tall.
10
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Sponges reproduce both by asexual and sexual methods of reproduction.
The asexual reproduction in sponges is by budding. The buds may be external or internal, The
internal buds are called gemmuies. Both types of buds develop into new sponges.
Some sponge species reproduce sexually.
These are mostly hermaphrodite,
mostly protandrous, i.e. male sex cells
develop irst. In some sponges the sexes
are separate. Sperms released in water
are carried to the eggs by amoeboid
cells. Fertilization occurs in mesenchyme
and zygote is formed. The embryo
development includes blastula and larval
stages.
Examples of sponges are :
i. Sycon: It is a typical marine sponge.
ii. Leucoselenia: A sponge that consists of group of erect tubes.
iii. Euplectella: It is beautiful and delicate sponge made up of glassy framework. It is commonly
 called Venus lower basket.
iv. Spongilla: It is freshwater sponge.
Importance
The skeleton of sponges have long been used by man mostly for washing and bathing. Although
many artiicial sponges have been made from synthetic material, still the natural sponges are in
demand and is an important industry in many parts of the world. The best commercial sponges
are found in the warm waters of Mediterranean Sea. Sponges have great capacity to absorb water.
They are used in surgical operations for absorbing luids and blood. They are also used for sound
absorption in buildings.
GRADE RADIATA
Phylum Coelenterata / Cnidaria - Diploblastic Animals
11
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The name Cnidaria has been given to this group of animals due to the presence of special cells
called cnidocytes. These cells give rise to nematocysts-the stinging cells, characteristic of this
group.
Cnidarians have double layer organization and are therefore diploblastic having tissue grade
organization and have organs. During the development two germinal layers are formed the outer
ectoderm and inner endoderm from which their bodies are constructed. The ectoderm forms outer
covering and some cells of this layer in most animals give rise to nematocysts while the endoderm
cells become specialized for digestion of food. Between the two layers is a jelly-like mesoglea. In
these animals there is only one cavity which serves as digestive as well as body cavity which is called
gastrovascular cavity or enteron and opens to the outside by only one opening the mouth. So
the animals of this group have sac like digestive cavity.
In coelenterates the arrangement of body parts is in relation to centralized axis (symmetrical). An
object is symmetrical where there is a correspondence in form and arrangement of parts so that
a plane passing through the center divides it into similar halves. The coelenterates have radial
symmetry and are aquatic, found both in marine and freshwater habitats.
The coelenterates range in size from microscopic Hydra to macroscopic, Branchioceranthus, a
hydrozoan polyp that may reach two metres in length. Cnidarians are found in two basic forms
the polyps and the medusae. Polyps are cylindrical animals, which in most cases are nutritive in
function, hence named as gastrozoids. The medusae are umbrella like in form. These are free
swimming. The medusae are involved in sexual reproduction as they have gonads.
The mouth is surrounded by a series of tentacles. These bear stinging cells or nematocysts, which
are organs of defense and ofense.
The coelentrates are carnivores and feed upon small organisms which come into contact with
them. These organisms are immobilized by nematocysts and taken into the digestive cavity as food
where it is digested and then distributed by difusion.
The nervous system is in the form of a network of neuron cells forming an irregular net or plexus
in the body-wall. There is no central nervous system.
Many colonial coelenterates such as corals produce a hard exoskeleton formed of calcium carbonate
12
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
(CaC03
). It is secreted by epidermal cells that take lime from sea water. The skeleton of coral is
responsible for formation of small coral islands or large coral reefs.

Most species are sessile, for example Hydra, Obelia, sea-anemone and corals, while other are free
living and motile e.g. jelly ishes etc. Many live as solitary individuals e.g. Hryda jelly ishes and seaanemones and quite a large number are colonial e.g. physalia, vellela etc. A colony is an aggregation
of individuals or zooids that perform diferent functions for the colony.
In Coelenterates reproduction takes place by asexual as well as sexual means e.g. Hydra reproduces
asexually by the formation of buds on its surface. The bud after some time separate from the
parent and develops into a new individual. In Obelia for example there is asexual as well as sexual
reproduction. It has a kind of zooid known as blastostyle which gives rise to individual zooids called
medusae by asexual method. The medusae when released in water develop reproductive organs
which produce gametes that unite to form zygote from which Obelia colony is again formed.
The life cycle of coelenterates is characterized by the presence
of alternation of generations. There are two generations, one
reproduces by sexual means and the other by asexual means.
Both generations are diploid. Often the two generations consist
of one free-living and one attached stage. Therefore asexual
generation and sexual generation alternate with one another.
This is known as alternation of generations e.g., Obelia.
Polymorphism - A Characteristic Feature of Coelenterates (Cnidaria)
The occurrence of structurally and functionally more than two diferent types of individuals, called
the zooids within the same organism is called polymorphism.
For example, in Obelia there are feeding individuals, the gastrozooids; the individuals capable of
asexual reproduction only, the gonozooids, blastostyles and free-living or sexually reproducing
individuals, the medusae..
The common examples ofcoelenterates are:
i. Hydra : A freshwater - coelenterate. It exists only in polyp form, therefore
 alternation of generations is absent.
Some of colonial members
have upto ive diferent types
of zooids, performing diferent
functions for the colony e.g.
Physalia (portuguese man of
war).

iii. Aurelia (jelly ish) : The polyp is
reduced and medusa is dominant in
jellyish.
iv. Actinia (sea anemone) : The body
 consists of polyp only, enteron is
 divided by large partitions
 called mesenteries.
v. Madrepora : The body is covered with
 hard calcareous skeleton formed of
 calcium carbonate. They are commonly
 called corals. The skeleton forms large
 coral reefs and even small islands.

V: 1.1
Coral reefs
Corals are formed from the secretions produced by specialized polyps that are present in certain
coelenterates. These polyps become covered by stony cups due to hardening of their secretions.
From the mouth of the stony cup a polyp can pass out its tentacle for the purpose of feeding
and withdraw itself where not feeding. Most such Coelenterates are colonial. The stony net-work
or mass of such Coelenterates are called Corals. Living polyps are found on the surface layer of
corals whereas underneath the mass are dead stony
structures only and there are no polyps inside. The
stony masses that are formed in this way are called
coral reefs. These are mostly formed of calcium
carbonates (lime-stone).
Coral reefs are found in the coastal waters of Florida, West Indies, East Coast of Africa, Australia
and Island of Coral Sea.
GRADE - BILATERIA
Triploblastic animals -The Acoelomates
Phylum: Platyhelminthes -The Flatworms
General Characteristics
The name Platyhelminthes means “latworms”. The body of these animals is soft and dorsoventrally
compressed.
The Platyhelminthes are triploblastic acoelomates. There is development of a third layer, the
mesoderm, which separates the ectoderm and endoderm. The Platyhelminthes exhibit bilateral
symmetry, and body is unsegmented.
With few exceptions the Platyhelminthes are parasites, mostly endoparasites, i.e., live inside their
hosts. The most common examples are Taenia solium (tapeworm), Fasciola hepatica (liver luke)
and Schistosoma (blood luke). The parasites are more common in tropics. Some of these cause
diseases in humans. A few species are free living and found in freshwater, for example Dugesia
(planaria).
The corals because of their massive structure serve as
living place for a variety of sea life.
15
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Their size ranges from few millmeters (10 mm in case of Planaria) to several meters (tapeworm).
Much of the body space is taken up by a branching sac type digestive system. The digestive system
is poorly developed in some species or may be absent as in the tape-worms.
The excretory system consists of branching tubes ending in bulb-like cells, the lame cells.
A well developed nervous system is present in Platyhelminthes. It is in the form of either a simple
network of nerves or ganglia. The sense organs are present at the anterior end. Respiratory and
circulatory systems are absent.
The parasitic species absorb nutrients from the hosts. The free-living species (Planaria) feed on
small animals and bodies of dead and decaying animals.
The free-living forms are motile. They move by cilia present on their undersides (Planaria). In
parasitic forms the movement is restricted.
The Platyhelminthes reproduce both by sexual and asexual means of reproduction. Asexual
reproduction is by ission in which the animal constricts in the middle into two pieces, each of
which regenerates the missing part. The sexually reproducing species are hermaphrodite, i.e., both
male and female reproductive organs are present in the same individual. Larval form is sometimes
present.
The common examples of latworms are:
(i) Dugesia (Planaria) : A free-living latworms with a ciliated outer surface.
(ii) Fasciola (Liver luke) : It is an endoparasite in sheep and occasionally in human beings. It has
suckers used for attachment to host tissue. It completes its life cycle in two hosts, a snail, sheep or
man. It lives in the bile duct of its hosts.
(iii) Taenia (Tape worm) : An endoparasite of humans, cattle and pig, that completes its life cycle in
two hosts. The intermediate host is pig or cattle. The body is ribbon-like and divided into segments
called proglottids which contain mainly sex organs. The segments continue to break of and are
passed out from the intestine along with faeces.

Adaptations for parasitic mode of life
The parasitic Platyhelminthes have completely adapted themselves to parasitic mode of life by the
development of the following characteristics:
1. The epidermis is absent and there is the formation of resistant cuticle for protection.
2. They have developed adhesive organs, such as suckers and hooks, for attachment to the host.
3. There is degeneration of muscular system and nervous system.
4. The digestive system has become simpliied due to increased dependence on host.
5. The reproductive systems are complicated and the ova are produced in huge numbers to ensure
 continuity of the species.
6. The complexity of life cycle and presence of more than one host during the life cycle is also an
 important parasitic adaptation.
Fig. 10.6 Example of animals of platyhelminthes.
17
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Infestation
In Taenia (tape worm), the development of the zygote begins while it is still inside the uterus of
female. The last segments or proglottids and their uteri contain completely developed embryo. The
fully mature proglottids break of from the body and pass out of the body of man along with faeces
(undigested waste). The embryo inside the egg is round in shape and has six chitinous hooks.
It shows limited movement of contraction. In order to develop further it must reach a second
host which may be a cow. The parasite remains embedded in the voluntary muscles of cow. If
an improperly cooked beef is eaten by a person, the parasite which has not been killed begins to
develop further in the intestine of man.
Disinfestation
Once the parasite has entered the intestine of man it is diicult to remove it completely. In this
respect care should be taken to cook beef properly before eating it. So that there is no chance of
the parasite entering the digestive system but if it has entered then certain medicines are taken
to remove it. Its complete removal is necessary because if only head remains inside the intestine
it can grow into new tape-worm once again. Besides treatment with drugs, physicians also give
anema to the patient, to fully remove the parasite.
Triploblastic Animals - Pseudocoelomates
Aschelminthes (Phylum Nematoda) - The Round worms
General Characteristics
The name Nematoda means “pointed ends”. The animals included in this group nave elongated
worm like body with pointed ends. The nematodes are triploblastic and pseudocoelomates. One
end of the body is anterior, however the head is not clearly marked and there are no special sense
organs at this end. The nematodes exhibit bilateral symmetry and the body is unsegmented. The
body cavity is pseudocoelom. It is derived from the hollow space, the blastocoel, situated in the
blastula, an early stage in embryological development, and not from the mesoderm. It consists of a
number of vacuolated cells illed with a protein-rich luid which develops high hydrostatic pressure.
The nematodes range from small microscopic forms, to some form reaching a length of upto one
metre. The digestive system is in the form of alimentary canal with two openings. The opening at
the anterior end is mouth and at the posterior end is the anus. In parasitic nematodes the digestive
system is simple. A luid illed space is present between the body wall and alimentary canal. It
provides “tube within tube” type structure in nematodes. The excretory system consists of
18
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
two longitudinally running excretory canals which unite at the anterior end to form a single canal
that opens to the exterior through an excretory pore on the ventral surface. There is a nerve ring
around the pharynx, which give rise to dorsal, ventral and lateral nerve cords running throughout
the length of the worms. The sense organs are in the form of sensory papillae present on the lips
at the anterior end. The circulatory and respiratory systems are absent. The gaseous exchange
takes place through general body surface. Locomotion is by undulating waves of contraction and
relaxation of muscles. These muscles are arranged in four bands, two dorso-lateral and two ventrolateral. The circular muscles are absent, therefore the bending is dorso-ventral only.
The sexes are separate. The female gonads are ovaries and these produce eggs. These male gonads
are testes which produce sperms. A larval stage is present in the life cycle.
Importance - Parasitic Diseases
Aschelminthes is important from the point of view of its parasites of which it has a great variety
qausing some very serious diseases in man and plants.
Ascaris lumbricoides is an intestinal parasite of man.
The genus Rhabditis contains numerous species normally found in soil, organic matter or water and
feces of man or animals. Enterobius vermicularis commonly known as pin worm is cosmopolitan but
more common in Europe and America. Pinworms are
parasites in the human caecum, colon and appendix.
Their movement causes intense itching of anus,
inlammation of mucous membrane of colon and
appendix resulting in insomnia and loss of appetite.
Ancylostoma duodenale is commonly known as hook worm. It is a parasite of human small intestine
in Asia, North Africa and Europe. It is very dangerous because it holds the villi of intestine and sucks
blood and body luid. During feeding they produce an anticoagulant to prevent clotting of blood
and after feeding leave the wound bleeding. In children it can cause severe anemia and retard
physical and mental growth.
Round worms are everywhere outdoors, where they play
an important role in breaking down organic matter. A
single rotting apple may contain 90,000 worms. Billions
thrive in each acre of topsoil.

Triploblastic Animals - Coelomates
Phylum Annelida The Segmented Worms
General Characteristics
Most of the worms with which we are familiar are included in this phylum. They are segmented and
commonly called annelids, (from the Latin word for “ little ring”)
The body is metamerically segmented. The body becomes divided transversely into a number of
similar parts or segments. The subdivisions may be indicated externally by constrictions of the
body surface. Internally, the segments are separated from each other by septa extending across
the coelom. However, the various systems of body such as gut, blood vessels, and nerve cord are
continuous throughout the length of body penetrating each individual segment.
The animals are triploblastic and coelomate, showing bilateral symmetry. The annelids include
worms, which may be marine (Nereis), freshwater (stylaria) or found in damp soil (earthworms).
Some are parasites, for example, Hirudo - (leech).
The annelids show specialization of body structures. The organ systems are well developed.
Digestive system is in the form of alimentary canal which is divided into distinct parts, each
performing a speciic function. It has two openings, the mouth at the anterior end, and the anus
at the posterior end. The mouth is overhung by a lobed structure, the prostomium. In parasitic
species, the digestive system is poorly developed.
Annelids have true coelom i.e. the mesoderm splits into parietal layer which lines the body wall,
and the visceral layer which covers the alimentary canal, the space between the two layers of
mesoderm, is the coelom, and is illed in by coelomic luid, which serves- as hydrostatic skeleton
also.
Excretion takes place by specialized structures called nephridia. These are ciliated organs present
in each segment in the body cavity.
20
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
A well developed central nervous system is present in annelids. It comprises of a simple brain and
a solid double, longitudinal, ventral nerve cord. Nerves arise in each segment from the nerve cord.
Annelids are the irst group of invertebrates which have developed a closed circulatory system
- a system in which a circulatory luid called blood lows in a network of vessels known as blood
vessels. It transports gases and nutrients.
The respiratory system is absent. The exchange of gases is by difusion through the skin in to blood
capillaries. The skin is kept moist by ,mucus, and coelomic luid.
The body wall contains muscles which help in locomotion. The muscles are of two types:
a. Circular Muscles : These are arranged along the circumference of the body.
b. Longitudinal Muscles : These are arranged along the length of the body.
21
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The locomotion is brought about by the interaction of muscles and hydrostatic skeleton. Contraction
of circular muscle produces a pressure in the coelomic luid that forces the body to elongate.
Similarly contraction of longitudinal muscles produce a pressure in the coelomic luid that would
cause the body to widen. The organs of locomotion in annelids are chitinous chaetae or setae
embedded in sacs (earthworm) or on . parapodia present in the body wall (e.g., Nereis). Chaetae
are absent in leech.
The common mode of reproduction is sexual. Most annelids (Earthworm, leech) are hermaphrodite.
In some annelids (e.g., Nereis) the sexes are separate, the fertilization is external and a free swimming
trochophore larva is produced
during the life cycle.
Burrowing activity of earthworms
permits greater penetration of
air into the soil, and improves
drainage capacity of the soil.
It also enables roots to grow
downwards through the soil
more easily. Mixing and churning
of the soil is brought about when
earth which contains inorganic
particles is brought up to the
surface from lower regions.
Earthworm is perhaps most active
segmented worm in churning the
soil, therefore it is commonly
termed as natural plough.
Phylum Annelida comprises :
1. Class Polychaeta
2. Class Oligochaeta 3. Class Hirudinea
Class Polychaeta
These have a distinct head region with eyes and structure known as palps and tentacles. Sexes are
usually separate. The organs of locomotion are parapodia. They are mostly aquatic (marine). During
development these give rise to a trochophore larva. Important examples are Nereis, Chaetopterus.
22
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Class Oligochaeta
These animals have internal and external segmentation. Organs of locomotion are setae. Head
region not prominent or distinct. They are hermaphrodite (bisexual). No larva formed during
development e.g. Lumbricus terrestris, Pheretima posthuma and other earthworms. They may be
terrestrial or aquatic.
Class Hirudinea
They have body with ixed number of segments. Each segment has additional circular rings or
markings called annuli. They do not have organs of locomotion and move due to the contraction
of their body and with tne nelp of suckers. Mostly hermaphrodite and trochophore larva is formed
during development. They are aquatic. No distinct head is present but leeches have chitinous jaws
for making a puncture in the skin of the host. They also have an anticoagulant secretion which
is passed into the wound to allow smooth low of blood into its digestive system where it can be
stored for a long time e.g. Hirudo medicinalis (medicinal leech).
Phylum : Arthropods - Animals with Jointed Legs
General Characteristics
The phylum contains more species than any other phylum. They are commonly called Arthropods
(arthron = joint + pods = feet). Insects (cockroaches, grasshoppers, butterlies, mosquitoes) are
most commoh arthropods on the earth.
The body is segmented. Each segment is attached to its neighbour by means of a modiied portion
of cuticle which is thin and lexible. They possess jointed appendages. These appendages have
been modiied for specialized functions.
These are believed to have common origin with annelids because both have some common
characteristics such as segmented body, appendages and cuticle.
Arthropods have exploited every type of habitat on land and in water. The aquatic species include
both freshwater and marine. Many of these can ly, therefore visit air periodically.
23
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Arthropods are variable structurally. Some are worm-like centipedes while the others are lying
insects with the body divided into distinct regions, the head, thorax and abdomen. The body is
covered with waterproof chitinous cuticle secreted by the epidermis.
The coelom is not present as the main body cavity. Instead a haemocoel has developed. It is reduced
coelom and communicates with blood vascular system.
The digestive system is in the form of alimentary canal with two openings, the mouth and anus. It is
divided into diferent parts each performing a speciic function. The food comprises of small plants
and animals.
A well developed excretory system comprising of Malpighian tubules is present in arthropods. The
nitrogenous wastes are excreted in the form of solid uric acid.
A highly deyeloped nervous system is present. It consists of paired ganglia (simple brain) connected
to a ventral double nerve cord. A ganglion is present in each segment. Nerves arise from these
ganglia. The sensory organs are usually a pair of compound eyes and antennae etc.
Most arthropods possess an extensive tracheal system formed of air tubes called tracheae for
the exchange of gases. Main tubes open to the exterior through paired openings, called spiracles.
Aquatic art hropods respire through gills and book lungs.
The blood circulatory system in arthropods is unique. It is open circulatory system. The blood lows
in the body cavity bathing the tissues of the body. However, there is a primitive heart and a main
blood vessel situated dorsaliy. Blood is colourless as it is without haemoglobin.
The skeleton is external, i.e., exoskeleton. It is in the form of an outer covering, the cuticle which
is light in weight; and is formed chiely of chitin. It provides surface for the attachment of muscles
which help in locomotion.
The arthropods exhibit active and swift movements. They swim, crawl or ly depending upon the
habitat they occupy. The organs of locomotion are paired appendages and in some cases paired
wings also.
24
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Reproduction and Life History
The sexes are separate. The testes and ovaries, produce sperm’s, and eggs respectively.
Metamorphosis
Life history of insects is characterized by metamorphosis (meta = change + morphe = form). This is
an abrupt change of form or structure during the life cycle. There are three morphologically distinct
stages in the life cycle, the egg “inally“ develops into larva which is converted into motionless pupa
that inally develops into an adult. In some primitive insects the metamorphosis is incomplete. The
larva resembles adult and is called nymph or instar. It lives in the same habitat as adult.
Classiication
Phylum Arthropoda is a large group consisting of great variety among them. Some of its important
classes are as follows.
1. Class Crustacea : These arthropods are aquatic and have gills for respiration. On the dorsal
side of the cephalothorax the exoskeleton is in the fofm of carapace. In the exoskeleton deposition
of salts in addition to chitin makes
it more irm. The appendages
are modiied for capturing food,
walking, swimming, respiration
and reproduction. Coelom is
reduced and is in the form of
hemocoel. Head has two pairs of
antennal appendages, one pair
of mandibles (jaws) and two pairs
of maxillae. Sexes are mostly
separate e.g. Daphnia, Cyclops,
Crabs, lobsters, prawn, wood louse
etc. (Fig. 10.8)
25
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
2. Class Insecta : This is the largest group
not only of Arthropoda but of all the animal
kingdom and has great variety. Insects are
found everywhere, many show social behaviour.
The body in, insects has three distinct regions
head, thorax and abdomen. There are a pair of
antennae and compound eyes on the head. The
head is usually vertical to the body and jaws are
ventrally placed. The thorax has three segments
in which are present three pairs of jointed legs
and in many one or two pairs of wings. Abdomen
has varying number of segments. Brain is formed
of fused ganglia and double nerve cord is ventral.
Sexes are separate and animals are oviparous.
Metamorphosis takes place during development
e.g. dragonly mosquito, butterlies, moths,
wasps, and beetles etc. (Fig. 10.9). Fig. 10.9 Insects

3. Class Arachnida : Body has the anterior segments that are fused to form a combined
cephalothorax, with a pair of appendages called chelicerae with claws, two pairs as pedipalps
and four pairs of legs. There are no antennae and no true jaws. Abdomen may be segmented
or unsegmented with or without appendages. Respiration is by
gills or special structures called book lungs, excretion is by the
Malpighian tubules. Eyes simple, sexes are separate. They are
oviparous (lay eggs). No true metamorphosis e.g. scorpions,
spiders, mites and ticks.
Most spiders have eight eyes placed in such
a way as to give them panoramic view of
the predators and prey.
26
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
 Fig. 10.10 Arachtiids
4. Class Myriapoda:
The body is divided into large number of segments each having a pair of legs. A pair of antennae
and a pair of eyes are present on head e.g. centipedes and millipedes.
General organization of Arthropods
Arthropods have characteristics of higher forms such as bilateral symmetry, triploblastic, coelomic
cavity and organ systems and have reached the peak of invertebrate evolution. Two of their main
achievements are the chitinous exoskeleton and locomotary mechanism. These animals can walk,
swim and ly. The jointed appendages (limbs) have been modiied or diversiied for various uses in
the diferent sub-groups of Arthropoda.
Chitin is non-living, non-cellular and is secreted by the under lying epidermis. It is made of
polysaccharide.On the outer side of chitin,there is a waxy layer. In some Arthropods and in certain
parts in other Arthropods chitin is soft and lexible, in others it is hard. In general, it is for protection
but it also serves as lever for the movement of muscles of jointed limbs. The chitin in the jaws is
used for biting and crushing food. It also forms lens of the compound eyes the copulatory organs
and organs of defence and ofence.
27
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
In the young Arthropods such as insect larvae, chitinous exoskeleton is shed from time to time to
allow the growth of the larva. This process of shedding of exoskeleton is called moulting or ecdysis.
In short the exoskeleton of chitin in the Arthropods is one of the primary factors in the success of
Arthropoda as it helps them to adapt to a wide variety of habitat.
Arthropods share with annelids the characteristic of having the body divided into similar segments.
In Arthropoda however segmentation is not metameric and organs are not repeated in the diferent
segments. Each somite typically is provided with a pair of jointed appendages. But this arrangement
is often modiied with both segments and appendages specialized for diferent functions in diferent
habitats. However, in all kinds of habitat the jointed appendages provide an eicient means of
locomotion, ofence and defence and also help in reproduction.
Economic Importance
Man and insects have been at war for the same food, same place to live in. Insects attack man,
his domestic animals and also his crops, causing a number of diseases. They are not only a health
hazard but also cause economic loss to man by destroying his property and crops. Some insects are
also useful to him such as the honey bee or the silk worm. Insects are therefore of great importance
to mankind.
1. Harmful Insects : Many types of mosquitoes, lies, leas, lice and bugs transmit disease
causing organisms to man and domestic animals. We are familiar with mosquito of genus Anopheles,
the female of which transmits Plasmodium that causes malaria in man. The Tse-tse ly of African
countries transmits Trypanosoma, the cause of sleeping sickness and skin diseases. The common
house ly carries disease causing organisms to contaminate food and cause cholera, hepatitis etc.
Some species of Trypanosoma cause diseases in cattle, also.
A number of insects lay eggs on fruits and other commercial crops such as sugarcane, maize,
cotton and also on vegetables etc. The larvae of these insects damage fruits and the crops resulting
in economic loss to farmers. The locusts that move in large numbers from country to country cause
damage to standing crops and other plants.
2. Beneicial insects : The useful insects are the honey bee that provides man with honey and
also wax. Similarly the silk worm gives us silk. There are some insects that are predaceous on other
harmful insects. Some insects are scavengers and they eat up dead animal and vegetable matter.
Insect larvae are source of food for ish.

PHYLUM MOLLUSCA (L. Molluscus - soft)
General Characters
The phylum Mollusca consists of diverse group of organisms which include slow-moving snails and
slug, bivalved clams, and highly active cephalopods. The phylum includes over 50,000 living species
and is the second largest phylum of invertebrates. Giant squid is the largest invertebrate animal.
Molluscs also show a great diversity of form but all are built on the same basic plan.
Molluscs are triploblastic coelomates which exhibit bilateral symmetry. Most animals possess shell.
The body is covered by a glandular epithelial envelope called mantle which secretes calcareous
shell. The shell is protective, however it is handicap to locomotion, therefore some of the more
active molluscs show a reduction or loss of shell.
Molluscs are widely distributed. Some groups are exclusively aquatic (e.g., cephalopoda), freshwater
or marine. The others include terrestrial animals (land snail) living mostly in moist places.
The body is unsegmented and soft. The body can be divided into head, a ventral muscular foot
and a dorsal visceral mass containing most of the internal organs. Over the visceral mass mantle
is present which secretes a shell. The space between the shell and mantle cavity contains gills in
some animals. In the mouth cavity of many molluscs there is a rasping tongue-like radula provided
with many horny teeth.
The body is highly organized with complex digestive, respiratory, circulatory, excretory, nervous
and reproductive systems.
Digestive system consists of gut with two openings, the mouth and the anus.
The excretory organs are paired nephridia.
Except for Cephalopoda, the circulatory system is open. The coelom is divided into sinuses or blood
spaces. Heart pumps the blood into the sinuses. A respiratory pigment of blue in color, called
haemocyanin is present.
29
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1

The gaseous exchange is by gills mostly. In some cases such as snail, the mantle cavity is converted
into a lung.
The nervous system consists of three pairs of interconnected ganglia present in the head, foot and
body regions.
The organ of locomotion is a muscular foot, however in many species the movement is slow. The
others are sessile i.e. unable to move.
The sexes are separate. Trochophore larva develops during embryological development.
Classiication
The molluscs are classiied into six classes. The major classes are:
(i) Gastropoda
These are asymmetrical and their body is covered with usually coiled one piece shell. The animal
can withdraw itself into the shell. Both aquatic and terrestrial species are included in this class. The
aquatic species have gills while in land forms the mantle cavity is converted into lungs.
The common examples are:
i. Helix aspersa : It is commonly termed garden snail.
ii. Limax the slug
(ii) Bivalvia (Pelecypoda)
This class includes bilaterally symmetrical aquatic molluscs. The body is laterally compressed and
is enclosed by two pieces of shells hence the name bivalves. They respire by plate-like gills.
The common examples are:
(i) Mytilus: (marine mussel). (ii) Anodonta: (freshwater mussel),
(iii) Ostrea: (oyster).
30
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
(iii) Cephalopoda
The members of this class are bilaterally
symmetrical with dorso-ventrally lattened
body. All species are aquatic. The shell is much
reduced and internal. In most cases it is absent.
The animals are highly developed and active.
The common examples are:
i. Loligo: (squid).
ii. Sepia: (cuttleish).
iii. Octopus


Economic Importance of Mollusca
Some molluscs are indirectly harmful to man but most of them are beneicial. The harmful molluscs
are slugs and shipworms. Slugs are injurious to gardens and cultivations. They not only eat leaves
but also destroy plants by cutting their roots and stems. Teredo, a shipworm damages wooden
parts of ships. But many molluscs are great source of food for man in many parts of world. Large
quantities of clams, oysters and mussels are eaten in Far-east, Europe and America. Oysters are
regarded as delicacy.
Shells of freshwater mussels are used in button
industry. Also shells of oysters are mixed with
tar for making roads in America. Shells in
certain parts of the world are also used for
making ornaments. Some oysters also make
valuable pearls e.g. the pearl oyster.
 Fig. 10.11 Examples of molluscs
The brain of octopus is exceptionally large and complex for an
invertebrate brain. It is enclosed in a shell-like case of ‘Cartilage’,
and endows the octopus with highly developed capabilities to
learn and remember. In laboratory, octopus can rapidly learn to
associate certain symbols and can open a screw cap jar to obtain
food.

PHYLUM ECHINODERMATA - The Spiny skinned animals
General Characteristics
There are over 5,000 known species of echinoderms. They are marine organisms living at the sea
bottom.
The body is covered by delicate epidermis. The mesodermal cells develop a irm calcareous
endoskeleton which may bear spines and because of its origin, from mesoderm it is called
endoskeleton.
Echinoderms are triploblastic coelomates and exhibit radial symmetry. The mouth is on lower
surface (oral) and anus is on upper surface (aboral).
The echinodermata are exclusively marine and most of them are found at the bottom along shorelines
in shallow seas. Most species are free) moving however some are attached to the substratum.
All the larval forms of these animals exhibit bilateral symmetry but the adults show radial symmetry
which is an adaptation for their special mode of life.
The body may be lattened like biscuit (cake urchin), star-shaped with short arms (starish) globular
(sea urchin), star-shaped with long arms (brittle star) or elongated (sea-cucumber). There is a central
disc from which arms radiate.
The most unique characteristics of echinoderms is that a water vascular system is present in their
coelom. It is a complex system of tubes and spaces surrounding the mouth and passing into the
arms and tube feet. The water circulates through these channels. Water enters these canals through
a sieve-like plate called madreporite present on the aboral body surface.
The motile species move with the help of tube feet. Each tube foot is a soft saclike structure present
along the edges of grooves present in the arms.
The echinoderms exhibit low degree of organization. There are specialized organs for digestion and
reproduction, but there are no specialized organs for respiration or excretion. The nervous system
is also poorly developed. There is no brain, however a nerve ring is present around the pharyngeal
32
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
region. Similarly the circulatory system is poorly organized.
The sexes are separate and the fertilization is external. The larvae such as bipinnaria and
brachiolaria are complex, exhibit bilateral symmetry, and resemble those of chordates.
Regeneration, the ability to reform lost organs is common among echinoderms, starish, sea
cucumber, sea lily, brittle star and sea-urchin exhibit this characteristics.

The echinoderms are comparatively simple in structure, organization and physiology, and deserve a
place slightly below the annelid worms. However, these are placed at the top of the list of invertebrate
phyla. This is because there are a number of striking resemblances, between the echinoderms and
chordates, such as :
a. There is radial cleavage during the development of embryos in both phyla.
b. The blastopore forms the anus in echinoderms
as well in chordates (Deuterostomes).
c. There are certain common biochemical
peculiarities among echinoderms and chordates
e.g. phosphocreatin is present in both.
The common examples are:
Asterias (starish):
Sea urchin Sea cucumber
Cake urchin Brittle star

Echinodermata / Afinities
Echinodermata do not show close relationship to most invertebrates, but they do show ainities
with hemichordata. Both these have a number of common features among which are the formation
of coelom and retention of blastopore as the site for future anus. In both mesoderm is derived from
the cells close to the blastopore. Both possess mesodermal endskeleton where as the exoskeleton
is ectodermal in orgin while in invertebtrates the blastopore develops into mouth.
 Fig. 10.12 Examples of Echinoderms.
33
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The above resemblances between two phyla are neither accidental nor due to convergent evolution
but are because the two are closely related and both emerged from the same (common) ancestor.
Echinoderms also show very close resemblance with chordates because both have mesodermal
skeleton, are deuterostomous, in both lower chordates and echinoderms the early development is
almost similar. That is why they have been placed closest to phylum chordata.
Phylum Hemichordata
Hemichordates are a group that has a combination of both invertebrate (Echinoderm) and chordate
characteristics.
The hemichordate along with Echinoderms and chordates belong to the group deuterostome
branch of animal kingdom.
Because of their close relationship to chordates these animals are called prechordates. The common
examples of this phylum are Balanoglossus and Saccoglossus.
General Characters
1. Soft bodied worm-like animali.
2. Body is divided into an anterior proboscis, collar and trunk.
3. Body wall is made of unicellular epidermis with mucus-secreting cells.
4. Digestive tract is straight and may show variations.
5. Coelomic cavities correspond to each of the three body regions i.e. that of proboscis, collar and
 trunk coelomic pouches.
6. Circulatory system consists of a median dorsal and a median ventral vessel.
7. Respiratory system is composed of gill-slits forming a dorsal row behind collar.
8. Excretory system has single glomerulus connected to blood vessels.
9. Nervous system has a sub-epidermal plexus of cells and ibres.
34

V: 1.1

 Fig. 10.13 Balanoglossus and Saccoglossus
Phylum Chordata
This great phylum derives its name from one of the few common characteristics of the group -
The notochord. This structure is possessed by all members of the phylum either in the larval or
embryonic stages or through out life. The notochord is a rod-like semi rigid body of vacuolated
cells which are illed with proteinaceous material which extends in most cases the length of the
body between enteric canal and the dorsal hollow central nervous system. Its primary purpose is
to support and to stifen the body that is to act as skeletal axis.
It seems that the endoskeleton is the chief basic factor in the development and specialization of
higher animals.
The animals most familiar to us belong to the chordates including man himself.
The chordates show great variety and inhabit all kinds of habitat. All chordates possess three basic
characters which are as follows:
1. As already mentioned all possess the notochord.
2. All chordates have central nervous system that is dorsal in position and is hollow.
3. All chordates develop paired gill openings in embryonic stage. In some these are non-functional,
 while in others they are functional for some period in their liie history e.g. frogs etc. in still other
 these are functional throughout life e.g. amphioxus, and ishes etc.
35

Fig. 10.14 Amphioxus
Chordates have been divided into lower chordates, e.g. Amphioxus etc. and higher chordates which
are the vertebrates in which the notochord is replaced by the vertebral column and a bony brain
case cranium is also formed due to which they are also called craniates. Phylum Chordata has been
sub-divided as follows:
Protochordata (Acrania) (Lower Chordates)
Sub-phylum: Urochordata : Notochord and nerve cord only in the fee-swimming larvae. Adults
are sessile and enclosed in a covering called tunic. Therefore, they are also called tunicates e.g.
Molgula.
Sub-phylum: Cephalochordata: Notochord and nerve cord extend along the entire length of the
body and persist throughout life e.g. Amphioxus.
36

V: 1.1
 Table 10.2 Classiication of Phylum Chordates
Sub-Phylum Vertebrate (Craniate) (Higher chordates)
It includes animals which have cranium in which the brain is enclosed. It includes animals with
vertebral column that means that all chordates in this, group are under subphylum vertebrata and
are therefore vertebrates. Table 10.2 gives an outline of classiication of sub-phylum vertebrata.
It is customary to place vertebrates into two super classes.
(1) Pisces (Fishes) which includes class cyclostomata, class chondrichthyes, class osteichthyes.
(2) Tetrapoda (Four footed) which includes the classes amphibia, reptilia, aves and mammalia.
The former is made up of strictly aquatic forms and the latter of the land dwelling animals.
Vertebrates maybe divided into anamniotes or those without foetal membranes (cyclostomata,
chondrichthyes, osteichthyes and amphibia) and amniota or those with foetal membranes (reptilia,
aves and mammals)
37

Superclass Pisces
This super class includes classes, cyclostomata, chondrichthyes and osteichthyes. The class
cyclostomata includes most primitive living vertebrates which are without jaws. This distinguishes
them from the rest of the vertebrates. They are represented by the lampreys and hagish. Some of
their characteristics are as follows:
1. Body is long eel-like. 2. Scales absent.
3. No paired appendages. 4. Cartilaginous Skeleton.
5. Ventral Suctorial mouth. 6. Heart with one auricle.
7. Six to fourteen pairs of gills. 8. Digestive system lacks stomach.
9. Sexes are separate in lampreys. Hag ishes are hermaphrodite.
10. Fertilization external and there is a long larval period in Lamprey.
 Fig. 10.15 Lamprey
Class Chondrichthyes
This group includes the sharks and rays which have skeleton of cartilage but have many resemblances
to the bony ishes, the cartilaginous skeleton is considered a degeneratedjbharacter rather than
primitive character. Their main features are:
1. Body fusiform.
2. Mouth ventral olfactory sacs not connected to mouth cavity.
3. Placoid scales on the body.
4. Endoskeleton entirely cartilaginous.
38
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
5. Digestive system with J-shaped stomach.
6. Circulatory system has many pairs of aortic arches.
7. Respiration by means of 5 - 7 pairs of gills without the covering i.e. operculum.
8. No swim bladder.
9. Sexes separate.
10. Oviparous or viviparous
With the exception of whale the sharks are the largest living vertebrates, some reaching 30 - 50 feet
in length.
The skates and rays are bottom dwelling ishes. In these the anterior pairs of ins (Pectoral ins) are
much enlarged and are used for swimming like wings. Two members of this group are of special
interest (1) the sting rays and (2) electric rays.
In the sting ray the tail is long & whip-like and has sharp spines which can inlict very dangerous
wounds. The electric ray on the other hand has certain dorsal muscles modiied into powerful
electric organ which can give severe shocks & stun their prey.
Sharks are of economic importance; most are highly destructive to ish, lobsters & crabs. In some
parts of the world sharks are used as food by man. Commercially shark liver oil is extracted and
used in medicine as a source of vitamin A and D and shark skin leather is used for making articles.

Following are the characteristics of bony ishes :
1. They have more or less bony skeleton which has replaced the cartilaginous skeleton.
2. Notochord may persist in parts.
3. The skin has embedded dermal scales which may be ganoid, cycloid or ctenoid scales. No
 placoid scales.
4. Fins both, median (single) or paired and have in rays of cartilage or bone.
5. Mouth is terminal. Jaws either with or without teeth.
6. Respiration by gills supported by bony gill arches and covered by operculum.
7. A swim bladder is usually present with or without connection with the pharynx. This helps in
 bouyancy.
8. Two chambered heart with one atrium and one ventricle. Blood has nucleated red cells.
8. Brain with 10 pairs of cranial nerves.
9. Sexes are separate, gonads paired. Fertilization is usually external.
Adaptations to Aquatic Life:
The major adaptations in ishes for the aquatic mode of life are as follows:
1. Stream - lined body (boat shaped) The body of ish is such that it ofers little resistance to water
 while swimming.
2. Swim bladder: This is found in most bony ish except a few; it may or may not be connected to
 pharynx. It is mainly a hydrostatic organ & can change the gravity of ish by illing itself with gas.
 The ish qan thus loat high or sink lower in water. The gases that ill the swim bladder are either
 oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen and may be secreted by the gland in the swim bladder
 itself. In those ishes in which the swim bladder is connected to pharynx the bladder may be
 illed by gulping of air.
3. Fins: Fins are another important adaptation to aquatic life and are of two types
 (1) paired ins (Pectoral and Pelvic) and (2) unpaired ins which are dorsal, caudal (tail) and anal
 ins. Fins help in swimming as they keep balance of ish in water.
4. Circulatory System : Heart with two chambers, with aferent & eferent branchial system.
5. Respiratory system: In most ishes respiratory organs are the gills, adapted to receive oxygen
 dissolved in water and remove carbon dioxide in water as the gills have network of blood
 capillaries

Excretory Organs: Kidneys of ish are also modiied for excretion in the aquatic environment.
The vertebrates already considered are adapted to strict aquatic life. The group of ancient ish
known as dipnoi showed modiication of aquatic breathing system to meet the conditions of
terrestrial life by developing lungs. But this case is only an incident in the transition to land. There
are a number of diferences between water and land habitats.
1. Oxygen is more in the air than in water.
2. Dissolved substances are present in water for example diferent kinds of salts.
3. Temperature changes are more drastic in the terrestrial environment.
4. Land habitat provides a great variety of cover and shelter than aquatic habitat.
5. As a medium water provides greater support to the body than air.
6. Land afords a greater variety of breeding places than does water.
In their transition from aquatic to land environment animals had to undergo modiications or
adaptations to cope with the above conditions on land. This included:
1. Development of skin for protection against dry conditions of land.
2. The eggs of land animals are protected by shells from drying and mechanical injury. Also the
 size of the egg is large to provide space for storage of food.
3. The terrestrial animals developed lungs in place of gills which could take oxygen from air.
4. In connection with the development of lungs there are corresponding changes in the circulatory
 system to take oxygen from air.
5. For locomotion the paddle-like ins are replaced by jointed appendages modiied for walking,
 running, climbing and lying.
6. Sensory organs have become more advanced and specialized.

Super class Tetrapoda: These have 2 pairs of jointed limbs (tetrapods)
Class Amphibia
Amphibians are on the border line between aquatic and true terrestrial animals. Fossil evidence
from the Devonian period of earths history suggests that a large population of ish belonging
to the group lobe-ins (dipnoi) came to live in shallow fresh water. Some of these crawled from
one pool to another and therefore spent some time on land. This gave rise to the group that we
recognize as amphibians which are the irst vertebrates to come on land. Although amphibians have
acquired certain characters enabling them to live on land but at the same time they have retained
some aquatic characters as the result of their dependence on aquatic habitat. This double life is
expressed in their name. Structurally they are between the ish on one hand and the reptiles on the
other. In the transitions from water to land amphibians have developed limbs in place of ins, lungs
in place of gills and some changes in skin. Their circulatory system’ provides for lung circulation
but all of them in larval form retain their link with aquatic life by having gills, circulation of blood,
digestive system which are representative of aquatic mode of life. Because of their dependence on
water for their life history they are not a very successful group of vertebrates and are conined to
areas only where they can ind water or moist conditions.

The characteristic features of amphibians therefore are:
1. Skeleton is mostly bony. Body form varies greatly in the diferent amphibians, tailed or without
 tail.
2. Limbs usually four (tetrapod condition) but some are legless (e.g. caecilians). Webbed feet often
 present.
3. Skin smooth and moist with many glands. In some glands are poisonous, pigment cells
 (chromatophores) present in the skin. Scales absent.
4. Respiration takes place by gills in the larval stage and by lungs and skin in the adult.
5. Heart is 3-chambered with respect to atria and ventricle sinus venosus, truncus arteriosus are
 present, double circulation takes place through the heart.
6. Sexes separate, fertilization external, larval stage present.
7. Changes into adult by metamorphosis. Amphibians are anamniotes.
8. Amphibians are cold blooded (poikilothermic) animals and hibernate in winter.
 Examples frogs, toads, and salamander.
Class Reptilia:
Reptiles are adapted for existence solely on land in contrast to amphibians that are still tied more
or less to water or moist habitat. This indicates that reptiles have certain adaptations not found in
amphibians. Some of these advancements shown by reptiles are their characteristic features which
are as follows:
1. Reptiles have developed some sort of copulatory organ necessary for internal fertilization.
2. In amniotic eggs of reptiles the shell is leathery which can resist dryness and injury. They have
 large yolky eggs.
3. Reptiles have dry scaly skin which is adapted to land life.
4. Reptiles have protective embryonic membranes amnion, allantois, and chorion.
5. In reptiles the ventricle of heart is incompletely partitioned ensuring more oxygen
 supply through blood circulation to all parts of the body. In crocodiles ventricle is
 completely partitioned into two.
6. Most reptiles have better developed limbs well adapted for eicient locomotion.
7. Reptiles like amphibians are cold blooded (poikilothermic) and hibernate in winter.
The above characteristics are for terrestrial habitat in which the reptiles mostly live. However, it is
an established fact that reptiles have evolved from amphibians by undergoing the above changes
and have become fully terrestrial.

Reptiles lourished throughout Mesozoic era (225-65 million years). The climate which had been
suitable for reptiles in that period, became less favourable to them in tertiary period. So most of
them became extinct. The existing reptiles belong to four, out of a dozen or more main lines that
existed in the past.
The present day reptiles are, irstly, the lizards and snakes. Secondly the tuatra (sphenodon) of
New Zealand, which have survived upto today with little change. Thirdly the crocodiles, which are
an ofshoot from the stock from which modem birds were derived. The reptiles of today have been
derived from dinosaurs of Jurassic (195-136 million years), and cretaceous period (136-65 million
years).
The modem reptiles for the most part live in the temperate and tropical zones indeed they lourish
only in the latter.

Class Aves - Birds
Birds are one of the most interesting and most widely known group of animals. Birds share with
mammals the highest development in the animal kingdom. It is believed that both birds and
mammals have evolved from reptiles along diferent lines. The earliest known bird fossil is that
of archaeopteryx, two species of which have been found from rocks of Jurassic period of earth’s
history. The fossil shows that archaeopteryx, was about the size of a crow with skull similar to
that of present day birds. It had bony teeth in the jaw socket unlike modem birds which do not
have teeth. Jaws extended into a beak and there was a long tail. Each wing had three claws. With
the exception of feathers these birds showed resemblance to the dinosaurs (giant reptiles of the
past). Many fossils of birds from later eras of earth history have also been found that had teeth.
The above evidence suggests that birds evolved from reptilian ancestors. The archaeopteryx and
others had characteristic of both reptiles and birds and therefore form a connecting link between
the two distinct groups.

Characters of Birds
1. Body is stream-lined and spindle shaped with four divisions, viz; head, neck, trunk and tail.
 These are warm-blooded (homeothermic).
2. Limbs are adapted for lying. The fore-limbs are modiied into wings and hind limbs for perching
 and in some birds for running as in ostrich.
3. There is the epidermal exoskeleton of feathers, legs bear scales.
4. The skeleton is light due to air spaces which is an adaptation for lying.
5. The skull has large sockets, jaws extend into homy beak, teeth are absent.
6. The circulatory system has 4-chambered heart and there is only right aorta which curves to the
 right side and then bends backwards.
7. The lungs have extensions known as air-sacs which extend into the bones also.
8. The organ of voice is called syrinx, it is situated at the lower end of trachea near the origin of
 the two bronchi.
9. Excretory system does not have a bladder, urine is semi solid.
10. Sexes are separate. Fertilization is internal and eggs are of large size with much yolk. Only one
 ovary and oviduct is functional.
11. Since birds do not have teeth they have developed a thick muscular structure (Gizzard) which
 is used for crushing food.
12. Some birds have secondarily lost the power of light and are called running birds e.g. Ostrich,
 Kiwi, etc.

Class Mammalia - Mammals
The term mammal was given by Linnaeus to the group of animals which are nourished by milk
from the breast of the mother. The group is considered to be the highest in the animal kingdom.
Their advancement over other groups is quite pronounced. The most important advancement
is the evolution and development of their brain (nervous system) over the other vertebrates. It
is universally accepted by biologists that mammals have evolved from reptilian ancestors, the
cotylosaurs. This has been determined on the basis of the fossil record which is easily available
because of the hard bones that were preserved as fossils, unlike the birds which have soft bones
and mostly have not been preserved. The ancestors of mammals lived simultaneously along with
reptiles during the Jurassic times and have been called mammal-like reptiles. Some were only of
the size of mice and lived on trees. One of these early reptile was varanope that was found as
fossil in Texas. Probably at least ive groups of such mammal-like reptiles developed mammalian
characters and were 50% mammals. Mammals became dominant in the Cenozoic period.

General Characters of Mammals
Although mammals have evolved from reptiles they show many important structural diferences.
These diferences are in fact the general characters of mammals which are as follows:-
1. Most mammals have a body covering of hair instead of scales.
2. There is a muscular diaphragm in mammals that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities.
 This structure is not found in any previous group.
3. The lower jaw in mammals is composed of only one large bone and articulates directly with
 skull.
4. External ear or pinna in present. There is a chain of three bones in the ear Malleus, Incus &
 Stapes.
5. Mammals have deciduous and permanent teeth in some mammals e.g. man the teeth are in
 two sets, one in early life the milk teeth and later the permanent teeth.
6. Mammals have 4-chambered heart and only left aortic arch (in birds it is right).
7. Mammals are warm blooded (Homeothermic) animals.
8. The red blood cells are non-nucleated.
9. Mammals have well developed voice apparatus, the larynx and epiglottis.
10. Most mammals give birth to young (viviparous).
11. Mammals feed their young on milk produced by mammary glands of mother. Mammals are

classiied into three sub-classes.
1. Prototheria - egg-laying mammals
2. Metatheria - pouched mammals
3. Eutheria - Placental mammals including man
48
10. Kingdom Animalia eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
1. Sub-Class Prototheria The Prototheria is that group which has characteristics of both reptiles
and mammals and therefore form a connecting link between the two. They also provide evidence
of the evolution/origin of mammals from reptilian stock. Certain members of this sub-class are
adapted for aquatic life as the duck bill which has a bill similar to that of a duck and has webbed
toes. It has thick fur on its body. The female has mammary glands to feed the young. Both these are
mammalian characters. At the same time these animals have cloaca and cloacal opening instead of
separate openings for digestive system and urinogenital system. Both these characters are reptilian
characters. These animals are found in Australia, e.g. Duck bill Platypus & Echidna (Spiny anteater).
2. Sub-Class Metatheria Next to Prototheria, the Metatheria are the most primitive mammals They
are characterized by an abdominal pouch the marsupium where they rear their young. The young
when born are immature and are carried by the mother in the marsupium till they develop to their
maximum. During this period they are fed on the milk produced by the milk glands of mother, the
nipples of which are in the marsupium. For this reason these animals are also called marsupials or
pouched mammals, e.g. Opossum, Kangaroo and Tasmanian wolf found in Australia and America.
3. Sub-Class Eutheria This sub-class includes placental mammals. In the body of mother
development of young is maximum and the young when bom are fully developed. In these mammals
during development a structure known as placenta is formed through which the fetus is nourished.
Also the placenta has endocrine function i.e. it produces certain hormones, for this reason these
mammals are also called placental mammals. Placental mammals have maximum mammalian
characters but in some the hair have become modiied into scales (pangolin) and spines (porcupine).
Examples are man, whale, elephant, horse, rat, mice, bat, dolphin, etc.
Mammals being a very successful group live in all kinds of habitat i.e. land, fresh water and sea for
which their bodies are modiied.

V: 1.1

Bioenergetics is the quantitative study of energy relationships and energy conversions in biological
systems. Biological energy transformations obey the laws of thermodynamics.
All organisms need free energy for keeping themselves alive and functioning. All life on this planet
Earth is powered, directly or indirectly, by solar energy. But no organism can make direct use of
sunlight as source of energy for metabolism; all can use chemical energy in the food such as sugars
etc. The chloroplasts of the plants capture light energy coming from the sun and convert it into
chemical energy that gets stored in sugar and then in other organic molecules.
With the emergence of photosynthesis on earth, molecular oxygen began to accumulate slowly in the
atmosphere. The presence of free oxygen made possible the evolution of respiration. Respiration
releases great deal of energy, and couples some of this energy to the formation of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) molecules. ATP is a kind of chemical link between catabolism and anabolism.
The process of photosynthesis helps understand some of the principles of energy transformation
(Bioenergetics) in living systems. Photosynthetic organisms (higher land plants for instance) use
solar energy to synthesize organic compounds (such as carbohydrates) that can not be formed
without the input of energy. Energy stored in these molecules can be used later to power cellular
processes and can serve as the energy source for all forms of life. Whereas photosynthesis provides
the carbohydrate substrate, glycolysis and respiration are the processes whereby the energy
stored in carbohydrate is released in a controlled manner. So the photosynthesis acts as an energycapturing while respiration as an energy releasing process.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
(CONVERSION OF SOLAR ENERGY INTO CHEMICAL ENERGY)
Photosynthesis can be deined as the process in which energy-poor inorganic oxidised compounds
of carbon (i.e. C02
) and hydrogen (i.e. mainly water) are reduced to energy-rich carbohydrate
(i.e. sugar-glucose) using the light energy that is absorbed and converted into chemical energy
by chlorophyll and some other photosynthetic pigments. The process of photosynthesis in green
plants can be summarised as:
3
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Photosynthetic Reactants and Products
From above overall reaction of photosynthesis it becomes evident that carbon dioxide, water and
light are the reactants while glucose and oxygen are the products. Water appears on both sides
of the equation because water is used as reactant in some reactions and released as product in
other. However, because there is no net yield of H2
0, we can simplify the summary equation of
photosynthesis for purpose of discussion:
This is almost exactly opposite to the overall equation of aerobic respiration
.Photosynthesis uses the products of respiration and
respiration uses the products of photosynthesis. There is another important diference between the
two processes : Photosynthesis occurs only during day time, whereas respiration goes on day and
night. During darkness leaves (and other actively metabolizing cells) respire and utilize oxygen and
release carbon dioxide. At dawn and dusk, when light intensity is low, the rate of photosynthesis and
respiration may, for a short time, equal one another. Thus the oxygen released from photosynthesis is
just the amount required for cellular respiration. Also, the carbon dioxide released by respiration just
equals the quantity required by photosynthesizing cells. At this moment there is no net gas exchange
between the leaves and the atmosphere. This is termed as compensation point. As the light intensity
increases, so does the rate of photosynthesis and hence the requirement for more carbon dioxide
increases which respiration alone cannot supply. Similarly, the oxygen produced during photosynthesis
is more than the need of the respiring cells, so the result is the net release of oxygen coupled with the
uptake of carbon dioxide.
Water and Photosynthesis
Oxygen released during photosynthesis comes from water, and is an important source of atmospheric
oxygen which most organisms need for aerobic respiration and thus for obtaining energy to live. In
1930s, Van Niel hypothesized that plants split water as a source of hydrogen, releasing oxygen as a
by-product. Niel’s hypothesis was based on his investigations on photosynthesis in bacteria that make
carbohydrate from carbon dioxide, but do not release oxygen.

11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Niel’s hypothesis that source of oxygen released during photosynthesis is water and not carbon dioxide,
was later conirmed by scientists during 1940s when irst use of an isotopic tracer (O18) in biological
research was made. Water and carbon dioxide containing heavy-oxygen isotope O18 were prepared in
the laboratory. Experimental green plants in one group were supplied with H2
0 containing O18 and with
C02
 containing only common oxygen O16. Plants in the second group were supplied with H2
0
containing common oxygen O16 but with C02
 containing O18
.
It was found that plants of irst group produced O18 but the plants of second group did not.
Water is thus one of the raw materials of photosynthesis, other being carbon dioxide. Hydrogen
produced by splitting of water reduces NADP to NADPH2 (NADPH + H+
).
NADPH is the “reducing power” which, along with ATP also formed during ‘light reactions’, is used to
reduce C02
 to form sugar during ‘dark reactions’.

photosynthesis in most plants. Chloroplasts are present in very large number, about half a million
per square millimeter of leaf surface. Chloroplasts are present mainly in the cells of mesophyll
tissue inside the leaf (Fig. 11.1). Each mesophyll cell has about 20-100 chloroplasts. Chloroplast has
a double membrane envelope that encloses dense luid-illed region, the stroma which contains
most of the enzymes required to produce carbohydrate molecules. Another system of membranes
is suspended in the stroma. These membranes form an elaborate interconnected set of lat, disc like
sacs called thylakoids. The thylakoid membrane encloses a luid-illed ‘thylakoid interior space’
or lumen, which is separated from the stroma by thylakoid membrane. In some places, thylakoid
sacs are stacked in columns called grana (sing granum). Chlorophyll (and other photosynthetic

V: 1.1
Photosynthetic prokaryotes lack chloroplasts but they do

thylakoids.
pigments) are found embedded in the thylakoid membranes and impart green colour to the plant.
Electron acceptors of photosynthetic ‘Electron Transport Chain’ are also parts of these membranes.
Thylakoid membranes are thus involved in ATP synthesis by chemiosmosis.
Chlorophyll (and other pigments) absorb light
energy, which is converted into chemical energy
of ATP and NADPH, the products which are used
to synthesize sugar in the stroma of chloroplast.
PHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENTS
Light can work in chloroplasts only if it is absorbed. Pigments are the substances that absorb visible
light(380-750 nm in wave length). Diferent pigments absorb light of diferent wave lengths (colours),
and the wave lengths that are absorbed disappear. An instrument called Spectrophotometer is
used to measure relative abilities of diferent pigments to absorb diferent wavelengths of light.
A graph plotting absorption of light of diferent wave lengths by a pigment is called absorption
spectrum of the pigment.
Thylakoid membranes contain several kinds of pigments, but chlorophylls are the main
photosynthetic pigments. Other, accessory photosynthetic pigments present in the chloroplasts
include yellow and red to orange carotenoids; carotenes are mostly red to orange and xanthophylls
are yellow to orange. These broaden the absorption and utilization of light energy.
Chlorophylls
There are known many diferent kinds of chlorophylls. Chlorophyll a, b, c and d are found in
eukaryotic photosynthetic plants and algae, while the other are found in photosynthetic bacteria
and are known as bacteriochlorophylls.
Chlorophylls absorb mainly violet-blue and orange-red wave lengths. Green, yellow and indigo
wave lengths are least absorbed by chlorophylls and are transmitted or relected, although the
yellows are often masked by darker green colour. Hence plants appear green, unless masked by
other pigments (Fig. 11.4).

A chlorophyll molecule has two
main parts : One lat, square,
light absorbing hydrophilic head
and the other long, anchoring,
hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail.
The head is complex porphyrin
ring which is made up of 4 joined
smaller pyrrole rings composed
of carbon and nitrogen atoms. An
atom of magnesium is present in
the centre of porphyrin ring and is
coordinated with the nitrogen of
each pyrrole ring (Fig. 11.2) That is
why magnesium deiciency causes
yellowing in plants.
Haem portion of haemoglobin
is also a porphyrin ring but
containing an ironatom instead of
magnesium atom in the centre.
Long hydrocarbon tail which is
attached to one of the pyrrole rings
is phytol (C20 H39). The chlorophyll
molecule is embedded in the
hydrophobic core of thylakoid
membrane by this tail.
Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b
difer from each other in only one
of the functional groups bonded
to the porphyrin; the methyl group
(-CH3
 ) in chlorophyll a is replaced
by a terminal carbonyl group
(-CHO) in chlorophyll b.

The molecular formulae for chlorophyll a and b are:
Chlorophyll a : C55 H72 05
 N4
 Mg Chlorophyll b : C55 H70 06

 Mg
Due to this slight diference in their structure, the two chlorophylls show slightly diferent absorption
spectra and hence diferent colours. Some wave lengths not absorbed by chlorophyll a are very
efectively absorbed by chlorophyll b and vice-versa. Such diferences in structure of diferent
pigments increase the range of wave lengths of the light absorbed. Chlorophyll a is blue-green
while chlorophyll b is yellow-green.
Of all the chlorophylls, chlorophyll a is the-most abundant and the most important photosynthetic
pigment as it takes part directly in the light-dependent reactions which convert solar energy
into chemical energy. It is found in all photosynthetic organisms except photosynthetic bacteria.
Chlorophyll a itself exists in several forms difering slightly in their red absorbing peaks e.g. at 670,
680, 690, 700 nm.
Chlorophyll b is found alongwith chlorophyll a in all green plants (embryophytes) and green algae.
Chlorophylls are insolube in water but souble in organic solvents, such as carbon tetrachloride,alcohol
etc.
Carotenoids-accessory pigments
Carotenoids are yellow and red to orange pigments that absorb strongly the blueviolet range,
diferent wave lengths than the chlorophyll absorbs. So they broaden the spectrum of light that
provides energy for photosynthesis.
These and chlorophyll b are called accessory pigments because they absorb light and transfer
the energy to chlorophyll a, which then initiates the light reactions. It is generally believed that the
order of transfer of energy is:
Some carotenoids protect chlorophyll from intense light by absorbing and dissipating excessive
light energy, rather than transferring energy to chlorophyll. (Similar carotenoids may be protecting
human eye).

LIGHT-THE DRIVING ENERGY
Light is a form of energy called electromagnetic energy or radiations. Light behaves as waves as
well as sort of particles called photons. The radiations most important to life are the visible light
that ranges from about 380 to 750 nm in wave length.
It is the sunlight energy that is absorbed by chlorophyll, converted into chemical energy, and drives
the photosynthetic process. Not all the. light falling on the leaves is absorbed. Only about one
percent of the light falling on the leaf surface is absorbed, the rest is relected or transmitted.
Absorption spectrum for chlorophylls (Fig. 11.4) indicates that absorption is maximum in blue and
red parts of the spectrum, two absorption peaks being at around 430 nm and 670 nm respectively.
Absorption peaks of carotenoids are diferent from those of chlorophylls.
Diferent wavelengths are not only diferently absorbed by photosynthetic pigments but are also
diferently efective in photosynthesis. Graph showing relative efectiveness of diferent wavelengths
(colours) of light in driving photosynthesis is called
action spectrum of photosynthesis (Fig. 11.4)
Fi.g 11.3 Engel man illuminated a ilament of Spirogyra with light that had been passed through a prism. Aerobic bacteria moved
toward the portions of the algal ilament emitting the most oxygen, along the cells in blue and red portion of the spectrum.
The irst action spectrum was obtained by German
biologist, T.W.Engelmann in 1883. He worked on

Action spectrum can be obtained by illuminating plant with light of diferent wavelengths (or
colours) and then estimating relative C02
 consumption or oxygen release during photosynthesis.

spectrum of chlorophyll. The same two peaks and the valley are obtained for absorption of light as
well as for CO2
 consumption. This also shows that chlorophyll is the photosynthetic pigment.
However, the action spectrum of photosynthesis does not parallel the absorption specturm of
chlorophyll exactly. Compared to the peaks in absorption spectrum, the peaks in action spectrum
are broader, and the valley is narrower and not as deep.
(Photosynthesis in the most absorbed range is more than the absorption itself. Likewise,
photosynthesis in 500-600 nm (including green light) is more than the absorption of green light by
the chlorophyll). This diference occurs because the accessory pigments, the carotenoids, absorb
light in this zone and pass on some of the absorbed light to chlorophylls which then convert light
energy to chemical energy. When equal intensities of light are given, there is more photosynthesis
in red than in blue part of spectrum.

ROLE OF CARBON DIOXIDE :
A PHOTOSYNTHETIC REACTANT
Sugar is formed during light - independent reactions of photosynthesis by the reduction of CO2
,
using ATP and NADH, the products of light - dependent reactions. Obviously photosynthesis does
not occur in the absence of CO2
.
About 10 percent of total photosynthesis is carried out by terrestrial plants, the rest occurs in oceans,
lakes and ponds. Aquatic photosynthetic organisms use dissolved CO2
, bicarbonates and soluble
carbonates that are present in water as carbon source. Air contains about 0.03 - 0.04 percent CO2
.
Photosynthesis occurring on land utilizes this atmospheric C02
.
Carbondioxide enters the leaves through stomata and gets dissolved in the water absorbed by
the cell walls of mesophyll cells. Stomata are found in a large number in a leaf; their number being
proportional to the amount of gas difusing into the leaf. Stomata cover only 1 - 2 percent of the
leaf surface but they allow proportionalety much more gas to difuse.
The entry of C02
 into the leaves depends upon the opening of stomata. The guard cells guarding
the stoma, because of their peculiar structure and changes in their shape, regulate the opening
and closing of stomata.
Stomata are adjustable pores that are
usually open during the day when CO2
 is
required for photosynthesis and partially
closed at night when photosynthesis
stops.
REACTIONS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS
Photosynthesis is a ‘redox process’ that can be represented by the following simpliied summary
equation:
Daily rhythmic opening and closing of stomata is also due to an internal
clock located in the guard cells. Even if a plant is kept in a dark closet,
stomata will continue their daily rhythm of opening and closing.
12
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
However, it is not a simple, single step process, but is a complex one that is completed by a series
of simple steps or reactions. These reactions of photosynthesis consist of two parts:
The light-dependent reactions (light reactions) which use light directly and
The light-independent reactions (dark reactions) which do not use light directly.
Light dependent reactions constitute that phase of photosynthesis during which light energy is
absorbed by chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigment molecules and converted into chemical
energy. As a result of this energy conversion, reducing and assimilating power in the form of
NADPH (NADPH + H+
) and ATP, are formed, both temporarily storing energy to be carried alongwith
H to the light independent reactions.
NADPH provides energized electron (and H+
), while ATP provides chemical energy for the synthesis
of sugar by reducing CO2
, using reducing power and chemical energy of NADPH and ATP respectively,
produced by light reactions. The energy is thus stored in the molecules of sugar. This phase of
photosynthesis is also called dark reactions because these reactions do not use light directly and
can take place equally well both in light and dark provided NADPH2
 and ATP of light reactions are
available.

Light dependent Reactions
(Energy-conversion phase; formation of ATP and NADPH)
As has been described previously, sunlight energy which is absorbed by photosynthetic pigments
drives the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthetic pigments are organized into clusters, called
photosystems, for eicient absorption and utilization of solar energy in thylakoid membranes (Fig.
11.6).
Fig. 11.6: Light harvesting photosystem. Energy of light (photon) absorbed by photosynthetic pigment molecules is transferred from
molecule to molecule, and inally reaches the reaction centre where actual energy conversion begins.
15
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Each photosystem consists of a light-gathering ‘antenna complex’ and a ‘reaction center’. The
antenna complex has many molecules of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids, most of
them channeling the energy to reaction center. Reaction center has one or more molecules of
chlorophyll a along with a primary electron acceptor, and associated electron carriers of ‘electron
transport system’. Chlorophyll a molecules of reaction center and associated proteins are closely
linked to the nearby electron transport system. Electron transport system plays role in generation
of ATP by chemiosmosis (which will be discussed in later section). Light energy absorbed by the
pigment molecules of antenna complex is transferred ultimately to the reaction center. There the
light energy is converted into chemical energy.
There are two photosystems, photosystem I (PS I) and photosystem II (PS II). These are named
so in order of their discovery. Photosystem I has chlorophyll a molecule which absorbs maximum
light of 700 nm and is called P700, whereas reaction center of photosystem II has P680, the form
of chlorophyll a which absorbs best the light of 680 nm. A specialized molecule called, primary
electron acceptor is also associated nearby each reaction center. This acceptor traps the high
energy electrons from the reaction center and then passes them on to the series of electron carriers.
During this energy is used to generate ATP by chemiosmosis.
In predominant type of electron transport called non-cyclic electron low, the electrons pass
through the two photosystems. In less common type of path called cyclic electron low only
photosystem I is involved. Formation of ATP during non-cyclic electron low is called non-cyclic
phosphorylation while that during cyclic electron low is called cyclic phosphorylation.
Non-cyclic Phosphorylation
1. When photosystem II absorbs light, an electron excited to a higher energy level in the reaction
 center chlorophyll P680 is captured by the primary electron acceptor of PS II. The oxidized
 chlorophyll is now a very strong oxidizing agent; its electron “hole” must be illed.
2. This hole is illed by the electrons which are extracted, by an enzyme, from water. This reaction
 splits a water molecules into two hydrogen ions and an oxygen atom, which immediately
 combines with another oxygen atom to form O2
. This water splitting step of photosynthesis that
 releases oxygen is called photolysis. The oxygen produced during photolysis is the main source
 of replenishment of atmospheric oxygen.
3. Each photoexcited electron passes from the primary electron acceptor of photosystem II to
 photosystem I via an electron transport chain. This chain consists of an electron carrier called

16
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
 plastoquinone (Pq), a complex of two cytochromes and a copper containing protein called
 plastocyanin (Pc).
4. As electrons move down the chain, their energy goes on decreasing and is used by thylakoid
 membrane to produce ATP. This ATP synthesis is called photophosphorylation because it is
 driven by light energy. Speciically, ATP synthesis during non-cyclic electron low is called non-
 cyclic photophosphorylation. This ATP generated by the light reactions will provide chemical
 energy for the synthesis of sugar during the Calvin cycle, the second major stage of photosynthesis.
5. The electron reaches the “bottom” of the electron transport chain and ills an electron “hole” in
 P700, the chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center of photosystem I. This hole is created
 when light energy is absorbed by molecules of P700 and drives an electron from P700 to the
 primary acceptor of photosystem I.
6. The primary electron acceptor of photosystem I passes the photoexcited electrons to a second
 electron transport chain, which tmasmits them to ferredoxin (Fd), an iron containing protein.
 An enzyme called NADP reductase then transfers the electrons from Fd to NADP. This is the
 redox reaction that stores the high-energy electrons in NADPH. The NADPH molecule will provide
 reducing power for the synthesis of sugar in the Calvin cycle.
The path of electrons through the two photosystems during non-cyclic photophosphorylation is
known as Z-scheme from its shape.

Chemiosmosis
In both cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation, the mechanism for ATP synthesis is
chemiosmosis, the process that uses membranes to couple redox reactions to ATP production.
Electron transport chain pumps protons (H+
) across the membrane of thylakoids in case of
photosynthesis into the thylakoids space. The energy used for this pumping comes from the
electrons moving through the electron transport chain. This energy is transformed into potential
energy stored in the form of H+
 gradient across the membrane. Next the hydrogen ions move down
their gradient through special complexes called ATP synthase which are built in the thylakoid
membrane. During this difusion of H+ the energy of electrons is used to make ATP (Fig. 11.9).

Light independent (or Dark) Reactions
Calvin cycle : carbon ixation and reduction phase, synthesis of sugar
The dark reactions take place in the stroma of chloroplast. These reactions do not require light
directly and can occur in the presence or absence of light provided the assimilatory power in the
form of ATP and NADPH, produced during light reactions is available. Energy of these compounds
is used in the formation of carbohydrates from C02
, and thus stored their in. These reactions can
be summarised as follows (Fig. 11.10 ):
The details of path of carbon in these reactions were discovered by Melvin Calvin and his colleagues
at the University of California. Calvin was awarded Nobel Prize in 1961.
The cyclic series of reactions, catalyzed by respective enzymes, by which the carbon is ixed and
reduced resulting in the synthesis of sugar during the dark reactions of photosynthesis is called
Calvin Cycle.
The Calvin cycle can be divided into three phases: Carbon ixation, Reduction, and Regeneration
of CO2
 acceptor (RuBP) (Fig 11.10).
Phase 1: Carbon ixation: Carbon ixation refers to the initial incorporation of CO2
 into organic
material. Keep in mind that we are following three molecules of CO2
 through the reaction (because
3 molecules of CO2
 are required to produce one molecule of carbohydrate, a triose). The Calvin
cycle begins when a molecule of CO2
 reacts with a highly reactive phosphorylated ive - carbon
sugar named ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme ribulose
bisphosphate carboxylase, also known as Rubisco (it is the most abundant protein in chloroplasts,
and probably the most abundant protein on Earth). The product of this reaction is an highly unstable,
six - carbon intermediate that immediately breaks into two molecules of three - carbon compound
called 3 - phosphoglycerate (phosphoglycerie acid-PGA). The carbon that was originally part
of CO2
 molecule is now a part of an organic molecule; the carbon has been “ixed”. Because the
product of initial carbon ixation is a three - carbon compound, the Calvin cycle is also known as C3
pathway.

11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Phase 2: Reduction: Each molecule of (PGA) receives an additional phosphate from ATP of light
reaction, forming 1,3 - bisphosphoglycerate as the product. 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate is reduced to
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate(G3P) by receiving a pair of electrons donated from NADPH of light
reactions. G3P is the same three-carbon sugar which is formed in glycolysis (irst phase of cellular
respiration) by the splitting of glucose. In this way ixed carbon is reduced to energy rich G3P with
the energy and reducing power of ATP and NADPH (both the products of light-dependent reactions),
having the energy stored in it. Actually G3P, and not glucose, is the carbohydrate produced directly
from the Calvin cycle. For every three molecules of CO2
 entering the cycle and combining with 3
molecules of ive-carbon RuBP, six molecules of G3P (containing 18 carbon in all) are produced. But
only one molecule of G3P can be counted as a net gain of carbohydrate. Out of every six molecules
of G3P formed, only one molecule leaves the cycle to be used by the plant for making glucose,
sucrose starch or other carbohydrates, and other organic compounds; the other ive molecules are
recycled to regenerate the three molecules of ive-carbon RuBP, the CO2
 acceptor.
Phase 3: Regeneration of CO2 acceptor, RuBP: Through a complex series of reactions, the carbon
skeletons of ive molecules of three-carbon G3P are rearranged into three molecules of ive-carbon
ribulose phosphate (RuP). Each RuP is phosphorylated to ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), the very
ive-carbon C02
 acceptor with which the cycle started. Again three more molecules of ATP of light
reactions are used for this phosphorylation of three RuP molecules. These RuBP are now prepared
to receive C02
 again, and the cycle continues.

 RESPIRATION
Living organisms need energy to carry on their vital activities. This energy is provided from within
the cells by the phenomenon of respiration. Respiration is the universal process by which organisms
breakdown complex compounds containing carbon in a way that allows the cells to harvest a
maximum of usable energy.
In biology the term respiration is used in two ways. More familiarly the term respiration means
the exchange of respiratory gases (CO2 and O2
) between the organism and its environment. This
exchange is called external respiration. The cellular respiration is the process by which energy is
made available to cells in a step by step breakdown of C-chain molecules in the cells.
Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration
The most common fuel used by the cell to provide energy by cellular respiration is glucose,. The way
glucose is metabolized depends on the availability of oxygen. Prior to entering a mitochondrion,
the glucose molecule is split to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. This reaction is called glycolysis
(glycolysis literally means splitting of sugar), and occurs in the cytosol and is represented by the
equation:
This reaction occurs in all the cells and biologists believe that an identical reaction may have occurred
in the irst cell that was organized on earth.
The next step in cellular respiration varies depending on the type of the cell and the prevailing
conditions (Fig. 11.11).
24
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Fig. 11.11 Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, follows diferent catabolic pathways depending on the organism and the metabolic
condition.
Cell processes pyruvic acid in three major ways, alcoholic fermentation, lactic acid fermentation
and aerobic respiration. The irst two reactions occur in the absence of oxygen and are referred
to as anaerobic (without oxygen). The complete breakdown of glucose molecule occurs only in the
presence of oxygen, i.e. in aerobic respiration. During aerobic respiration glucose is oxidized to CO2
and water and energy is released.
25
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Anaerobic Respiration
(i) Alcoholic Fermentation: In primitive cells and in some eukaryotic cells such as yeast,
 pyruvic acid is further broken down by alcoholic fermentation into alcohol (C2
 H5
 OH) and CO2.
(ii) Lactic acid fermentation: In lactic acid fermentation, each pyruvic acid molecule is
 converted into lactic acid C3
 H6
 O3
 in the absence of oxygen gas:
This form of anaerobic respiration occurs in muscle cells of humans and other animals during
extreme physical activities, such as sprinting, when oxygen cannot be transported to the cells as
rapidly as it is needed.
Both alcoholic and lactic acid fermentations yield relatively small amounts of energy from glucose
molecule. Only about 2% of the energy present within the chemical bonds of glucose is converted
into adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Aerobic respiration (Discussed in detail under cellular respiration).
Role of mitochondria in respiration Mitochondria are large granular or ilamentous organelles
that are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of animal and plant cells. Each mitochondrion is
constructed of an outer enclosing membrane and an inner membrane with elaborate folds or
cristae that extend into the interior of the organelle.
Mitochondria play a part in cellular respiration by transferring the energy of the organic molecules
to the chemical bonds of ATP. A large “battery” of enzymes and coenzymes slowly release energy
26
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
from the glucose molecules. Thus mitochondria are the “Power houses” that produce energy
necessary for many cellular functions.
Adenosine triphosphate and its importance Adenosine triphosphate, generally abbreviated
‘ATP’ is a compound found in every living cell and is one of the essential chemicals of life. It plays
the key role in most biological energy transformations.
Conventionally, ‘P’ stands for the entire phosphate group. The second and the third phosphate
represent the so called “high energy” bonds. If these are broken by hydrolysis, far more free energy
is released as compared to the other bond in the ATP molecule. The breaking of the terminal
phosphate of ATP releases about 7.3 K cal. of energy. The high energy ‘P’ bond enables the cell to
accumulate a great quantity of energy in a very small space and keeps it ready for use as soon as
it is needed.
The ATP molecule is used by cells as a source of energy for various functions for example, synthesis
of more complex compounds, active transport across the cell membrane, muscular contraction,
and nerve conduction, etc.
Biological oxidation The maintenance of living system requires a continual supply of free energy
which is ultimately derived from various oxidation reduction reactions. Except for photosynthetic
and some bacterial chemosynthetic processes, which are themselves oxidation reduction reactions,
all other cells depend ultimately for their supply of free energy on oxidation reactions in respiratory
processes. In some cases biological oxidation involves the removal of hydrogen, a reaction catalyzed
by the dehydrogenases linked to speciic coenzymes. Cellular respiration is essentially an oxidation
process.
Cellular Respiration
Cellular respiration may be sub-divided into 4 stages:
i. Glycolysis ii. Pyruvic acid oxidation
iii. Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle iv. Respiratory chain
Out of these stages the irst occurs in the cytosol for which oxygen is not essential, while the other
three occur within the mitochondria where the presence of oxygen is essential.
27
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
i. Glycolysis Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose upto the formation of pyruvic acid. Glycolysis
 can take place both in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic condition) or in the presence of oxygen
 (aerobic condition). In both, the end product of glucose breakdown is pyruvic acid. The
 breakdown of glucose takes place in a series of steps, each catalyzed by a speciic enzyme. All
 these enzymes are found dissolved in the cytosol. In addition to the enzymes, ATP and coenzyme
 NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) are also essential.
Glycolysis can be divided into two phases, a preparatory phase and an oxidative phase (Fig. 11.12).
In the preparatory phase breakdown of glucose occurs and energy is expended. In the oxidative
phase high energy phosphate bonds are formed and energy is stored.
Preparatory phase The irst step in glycolysis is the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP
to glucose. As a result a molecule of glucose-6 -phosphate is formed. An enzyme catalyzes the
conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to its isomer, fructose-6 - phosphate. At this stage another
ATP molecule transfers a second phosphate group. The product is fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The
next step in glycolysis is the enzymatic splitting of fructose 1 ,6 -bisphosphate into two fragments.
Each of these molecules contains three carbon atoms. One is called 3 - phospo- glyceraldehyde,
3-PGAL or Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) while the other is dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
These two molecules are isomers and in fact, are readily interconverted by yet another enzyme of
glycolysis.
Oxidative (payof) phase The next step in glycolysis is crucial to this process. Two electrons or
two hydrogen atoms are removed from the molecule of 3- phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) and
transferred to a molecule of NAD. This is of course, an oxidation-reduction reaction, with the PGAL
being oxidized and the NAD being reduced. During this reaction, a second phosphate group is
donated to the molecule from inorganic phosphate present in the cell. The resulting molecule is
called 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate(BPG).
The oxidation of PGAL is an energy yielding process. Thus a “high energy” phosphate bond is
created in this molecule. At the very next step in glycolysis this phosphate group is transferred to a
molecule of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) converting it into ATP. The end product of this reaction
is 3-phospho glycerate (3-PG). In the next step 3-PG is converted to 2-Phosphoglycerate (2PG).
From 2PG a molecule of water is removed and the product is phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP). PEP
then gives up its ‘high energy’ phosphate to convert a second molecule of ADP to ATP. The product
is pyruvate, pyruvic acid (C3
 H4 O3
). It is equivalent to half glucose molecule that has been oxidized
to the extent of losing two electrons (as hydrogen atoms).
28
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
ii. Pyruvic add oxidation: Pyruvic acid (pyruvate), the end product of glycolysis, does not
enter the Krebs cycle directly. The pyruvate (3- carbon molecule) is irst changed into 2-carbon
acetic acid molecule. One carbon is released as CO2
 (decarboxylation). Acetic acid on entering the
mitochondrion unites with coenzyme-A (Co A) to form acetyl Co A (active acetate). In addition, more
hydrogen atoms are transferred to NAD (Fig. 11.13).
iii. Krebs cyde or citric add cycle: Acetyl CoA now enters a cyclic series of chemical reactions
during which oxidation process is completed. This series of reactions is called the Krebs cycle (after
the name of the biochemist who discovered it), or the citric acid cycle. The irst step in the cycle
is the union of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate to form citrate. In this process, a molecule of CoA is
regenerated and one molecule of water is used. Oxaloacetate is a 4-carbon acid. Citrate thus has 6
carbon atoms.
After two steps that simply result in forming an isomer of citrate, isocitrate another NAD- mediated
oxidation takes place. This is accompanied by the removal of a molecule of CO2
. The result
is a-ketoglutarate. It, in turn, undergoes further oxidation (NAD + 2H —> NADH) followed by
decarboxylation (CO2
) and addition of a molecule of water. The product then has one carbon atom
and one oxygen atom less. It is succinate. The conversion of a-ketoglutarate into succinate is
accompanied by a free energy change which is utilised in the synthesis of an ATP molecule. The next
step in the Krebs cycle is the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. Once again, two hydrogen atoms
are removed, but this time the oxidizing agent is a coenzyme called lavin adenine dinucleotide
(FAD), which is reduced to FADH2
.

Fig. 11.13 Outline of the Krebs cycle. The brackets give the number of carbon atom in each intermediate of the cycle.
With the addition of another molecule of water, fumarate is converted to malate. Another NAD
mediated oxidation of malate produces oxaloacetate, the original 4-carbon molecule. This
completes the cycle. The oxaloacetate may now combine with another molecule of acetyl CoA to
enter the cycle and the whole process is repeated (Fig. 11.13).
31
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
iv. Respiratory chain: In the Krebs cycle NADH and H+
 are produced from NAD+
. NADH then
transfers the hydrogen atom to the respiratory chain (also called electron transport system)
where electrons are transported in a series of oxidation-reduction steps to react, ultimately, with
molecular oxygen. (Fig. 11.14).
The oxidation reduction substances which take part in respiratory chain are:
i. A coenzyme called coenzyme Q
ii. A series of cytochrome enzymes (b,c,a,a3
)
iii. Molecular oxygen (02
)
Cytochromes are electron transport intermediates containing haem of related prosthetic groups,
that undergo valency changes of iron atom. Haem is the same iron containing group that is oxygen
carrying pigment in haemoglobin. The path of electrons in the respiratory chain appears to be as
follows.
Fig. 11.14 The repiratory electron transport chain and its coupling with oxidative phosphorylation.
32
11. Bioenergetics eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
NADH is oxidized by coenzyme Q. This oxidation yields enough free energy to permit the synthesis
of a molecule of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. Coenzyme Q is in turn oxidized by
cytochrome b which is then oxidized by cytochrome c. This step also yields enough energy to permit
the synthesis of a molecule of ATP. Cytochrome c then reduces a complex of two enzymes called
cytochrome a and as (for convenience the complex is referred as cytochrome a). Cytochrome a is
oxidized by an atom of oxygen and the electrons arrive at the bottom end of the respiratory chain.
Oxygen is the most electronegative substance and the inal acceptor of the electrons. A molecule
of water is produced. In addition, this inal oxidation provides enough energy for the synthesis of
a third molecule of ATP.
Oxidative phosphorylation: Synthesis of ATP in the presence of oxygen is called oxidative
phosphorylation. Normally, oxidative phosphorylation is coupled with the respiratory chain. As
already described ATP is formed in three steps of die respiratory chain (Fig. 11.14). The equation
for this process can be expressed as follows:
Where Pi is inorganic phosphate.
The molecular mechanism of oxidative phosphorylation takes place in conjunction with the
respiratory chain in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Here also, as in photosynthesis, the
mechanism involved is chemiosmosis by which electron transport chain is coupled with synthesis
of ATP. In this case, however the pumping/movement of protons (H+
) is across the inner membrane
of mitochondrion folded into cristae, between matrix of mitochondrion and mitochondrion’s
intermembrane space. The coupling factors in respiration are also diferent from those in
photosynthesis.

All organisms need nutrients for the maintenance of their lives. Nutrient is the food or any substance
that supplies the body with elements, necessary for metabolism. Certain nutrients (carbohydrates,
fats and proteins) provide energy other nutrients (water, electrolytes, minerals and vitamins) are
essential to the metabolic process. The sum total of all the processes involved in the taking in and
utilization of elements by which growth, repair and maintenance of activities in the organism are
accomplished maintenance of activities in the organism are accomplished is called nutrition.
Organisms can be divided into two classes on the basis of their methods of nutrition-autotrophic
and heterotrophic. Autotrophic organisms can exist in an exclusively inorganic environment
because they can manufacture their own organic compounds from the inorganic raw material taken
from the surrounding media. This means that they produce their own sugars, lipids, proteins etc.
from carbon dioxide, water and nitrates. Heterotrophic organisms are incapable of manufacturing
organic compounds from simple inorganic nutrients and so they obtain organic molecules from

See chapter 6 and chapter 11
Mineral nutrition in plants
Generally, all autotrophic or photosynthetic organisms need carbon dioxide and water, which
supply the carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. These are the predominant elements, the plant needs for
the synthesis of organic molecules. There are many other elements that enter into the composition
of plants. Nitrogen for example, is present in proteins, phosphorus is present in ATP, nucleic
acids and many other important compounds; chlorophyll contains magnesium and cytochromes
contain iron. Where does the green plant obtain these elements it needs? Obviously not from
carbon dioxide and water, but the soil is the main source of these nutrients. These are essential for
the growth and life of the plant. Crops fail to lourish, if grown repeatedly in the same ield unless
soil is replenished with these nutrients. The farmers replace these by spreading animal manure,
sewage sludge or artiicial fertilizers in measured quantities over the ield. Some chemical fertilizers
that are commonly used in Pakistan are urea, super phosphates, ammonium nitrate etc.

Mineral Element Deiciencies
It is very diicult or not possible to ascertain the efects of individual minerals in both plants
and animals. However, the deiciencies of some elements cause serious diseases showing clear
symptoms. For example nitrogen deiciency in soil results in the stunted growth and strong chlorosis
(lack of chlorophyll) particularly in older leaves. Deiciency of phosphorus causes stunted growth of
roots. Soil deicient in potassium causes leaf margins yellow and brown in colour and premature
death of the plant. Deiciency of magnesium results in chlorosis. Many economically important
plant diseases due to mineral deiciency are now catalogued with the help of colour photography,
enabling rapid diagnosis.
HETEROTROPHIC NUTRITION
METHODS OF PLANT NUTRITION
The plants generally obtain their food from the air or the water in which they grow. There are,
however, some special methods of nutrition , which are described below.
Saprophytic Nutrition
Feeding on dead and decaying matter such as dead leaves in the soil or rotting tree trunks is
called saprophytic nutrition and derives its nutrients from host plants. They produce extracellular
enzymes, which digest the decaying matter and then absorb the soluble products back into their
cells. Some bacteria break down the proteins of dead plants and animals and release nitrates which
are taken up by the plant roots and then built into new amino acids and proteins, thus helping in
nitrogen cycle.
Parasitic Nutrition
Feeding by living in or on other organism (host) belonging to diferent species is called parasitic
nutrition. Parasites attach themselves to living things or their host, for nourishment. For obtaining
nourishment from higher plant the parasite penetrates its suckers in the conducting tissue of the
host. Puccinia is a parasitic fungus that destroys the wheat plant. Dodder (Cuscuta)is a lealess
plant that lives as a twining parasite.

V: 1.1
Symbiotic Nutrition
It is a mutual nutrition between organisms living in association with one another. These organisms
belong to two diferent species. Some important examples are lichens, mycorrhiza and root nodules
with nitrogen ixing bacteria. The lichen is made up of a fungus and alga cells. The alga makes
food by photosynthesis, while the fungus supplies water and minerals and also protection against
desiccation (Fig. 12.1). Mycorrhiza is an association between a fungus and roots of higher plants.
The fungus depends upon the photosynthate of the plant. The beneit derived by mycorrhiza plant
is not properly understood. However, it is known that the
plants with mycorrhiza association show better growth
than those without fungal partner. Leguminous plants
have nodules on their roots, which contain nitrogen ixing
bacteria (Fig. 12.2). The bacteria live on the plant material
and ix nitrogen, converting it into nitrates, which the
plant uses.
Nutrition in insectivorous plants. There are a few plants that supplement their inorganic diet
with organic compounds. These organic compounds are obtained by trapping and digesting insects
and small animals. All of the insectivorous plants are true autotrophs, but when they capture prey,
their growth becomes rapid. Apparently, nitrogenous compounds of animal body are of beneit
to these plants. In some plants, the trapped insects are decomposed by bacteria. In others the
trapped insects are digested by enzymes secreted by the leaves. The plants absorb the nitrogenous
compounds thus formed.
Possibly the Mycorrhizal fungus
beneits the plant by decomposing
organic material in the soil and
providing water and minerals such as
phosphorous to plant.

Pitcher plant (Sarracenia pupurea) has leaves modiied into a sac or a pitcher, partly illed with
water (Fig. 12.3). The end of the leaf is modiied to form a hood, which partly covers the open
mouth of the pitcher. Small insects that fall into the pitcher are prevented from climbing out by
numerous stif hairs. The proteins of trapped insects are decomposed by bacteria or enzymes and
the products of this decay are absorbed by the inner surface of the pitcher leaf.
Venus-ly trap (Dionaea muscipula) The leaf is bilobed with midrib between them. There is a
row of long stif bristles along the margins of each lobe. When an insect touches small sensitive
hairs on the surface of the leaf, the lobes quickly come together with their bristles interlocked. The
trapped insect is then digested by the enzymes secreted from the glands on the leaf surface and
the products are then absorbed (Fig. 12.4).

(Fig. 12.5). The tiny leaves bear numerous hair like tentacles, each with a gland at its tip. The insects,
attracted by the plant’s odour are entagled. As in the above mentioned example, in sundew also
the proteins of insects are digested by enzymes and the products are absorbed.

Methods of Animal Nutrition
In large animals, every cell of the body needs nourishment, yet most cells cannot leave their position
in the body and travel to a food source, so the food must be delivered. The digestive system provides
the body with water, electrolytes, and other nutrients. To do this, digestive system is specialized to
ingest food; propel it through the digestive tract; digest the food; and absorb water; electrolytes
and other nutrients from the lumen of the digestive tract. Undigested matter from the food is
moved out of the digestive tract.
Animals exhibit more variety of nutrition as compared to the plants. On the basis of nutrition
animals may be classiied as:
Detritivores: The animals which feed on detritus (organic debris from decomposing plants and
animals) are called detritivores. Earthworm is the common example of detritus feeder. It ingests
fragments of decaying organic matter especially vegetation either at the soil surface or during
burrowing activity.
Herbivores: Animals that feed on plants are called herbivores. Typical herbivores include insects,
reptiles, birds and mammals. Two important groups of herbivorous mammals are rodents and
ungulates. The later are hoofed grazing animals, such as horses, cattle and sheep. In herbivorous
mammals the premolars and molars have large grinding surfaces. There is a large gap between
the incisors and premolars. Canines are missing. In grazing and browsing herbivores, i.e. deer and
sheep, there are no upper incisors.
Carnivores: Animals which feed on other animals are called carnivores. They have large canine
teeth for catching and tearing the prey. Incisors , premolars and molars are all adapted for cutting
lesh, cracking bones and reducing the chunks to sizes suitable for swallowing. Cats, dogs, lions
and tigers are common examples of carnivores. A
predator is an animal, which captures and readily
kills live animal for its food. The animal, which is
eaten, is the prey.
Omnivores: These are the animals which eat both plant and animal food. Example of omnivores
are crows, rats, red fox, bears, pigs and man. They have the teeth structurally and functionally
intermediate between the extremes of specialization attained by the teeth of herbivores and
carnivores.
The predator-prey interaction helps in maintaining
ecosystem stable. A species in the area without its natural
predator leads to disastrous results. The introduction of
rabbits into Australia without the predator multiplied to
enormous number and proved a menace to the farmers.

Filter feeders: Many aquatic animals ilter the water and digest the particles that they extract
from it.
A common mussel possesses two large gills covered with cilia. The movement of cilia causes a
current of water to enter animal via an inhalent siphon (Fig. 12.6). The water, which enters, contains
the food, such as microscopic algae and protozoa. Secretory cells scattered among cilia produce
sticky mucus which entangles food particles. The trapped food particles are then swept towards
the mouth by the ciliary movement. Certain types of whales are also ilter feeder.
Fig. 12.6 Filter feeding in mussel
Fluid feeders: When the food is ingested in liquid form the animals are classed as luid feeders.
Aphids and mosquitoes are the examples. Aphids suck the phloem juices out of the green stems
by inserting their delicate stylets. The female mosquito is also a luid feeder because it sucks blood
from the skin capillaries by piercing the skin with the help of tubular mouth parts.
Macrophagous feeders: Animals, which take in food in the form of large pieces, are
macrophagous feeders. Tentacular feeding, scraping and seizing prey are the common methods of
macrophagous feeding. Feeding in Hydra is the example of tentacular feeding.
Scraping type of feeding occurs in the garden snail (Helix). It feeds by using rasping organ, the
radula. Leaves are held by the lips of the snail. The radula moves back and forth over the leaves
9
12. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
with its teeth scraping the food. In this way tiny fragments of leaves are obtained which are gradually
pushed backward towards the pharynx. Seizing and swallowing type of macrophagous feeding is
found in spotted dogish.
Parasitic Nutrition
A parasite is an organism that lives upon or within another organism, called the host, for obtaining
its food. A parasite that lives upon the host is an ectoparasite and that which lives within the host is
an endoparasite. If an organism lives parasitically at all times, it is said to be an obligate parasite.
Facultative parasites are capable of living independently of its host at times.
Flea and lice are ectoparasites that live in the fur or feafhers of mammals and birds and suck blood
from their skin. Ticks and mites are common ectoparasites in non-human mammals. In plants,
aphid is a parasite that sucks food from leaves or stems.
Leech is another common example of ectoparasite attacking both aquatic and terrestrial animals.
Endoparasites also occur in both aquatic and terrestrial animals. These parasites are most commonly
found in the intestine of vertebrate host, including man, where they absorb host’s digested food.
Entamoeba histolytica, tape worm and round worms are common examples of endoparasites. In
certain cases the host may be weakened by the presence of parasite or its metabolism may be
upset by the excretory products of parasite.
DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION
All animals have similar requirements, although these requirements difer in detail. Animals must
have the supply of water, oxygen, simple sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins and many other
inorganic and organic substances. These substances, except oxygen and water, are rare in the
natural environment and are not directly available to the organisms. In nature these substances are
available in the form of proteins, starches, fats, vitamins and minerals. As such, these moleculesr
except vitamins and minerals are of no use unless they are broken down or digested into simple
molecules such as amino acids, sugars and fatty acids so that they many pass through the cell
membrane and be used by the body. The characteristic processes involved in holozoic nutrition
are deined as
10
12. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
(a) Ingestion taking in of complex food.
(b) Digestion- the breakdown of complex organic compounds of food into simpler difusible
molecules by the action of enzymes e.g. proteins (meat, ish, eggs etc.) into amino acids. Digestion
may be either Intracellular or extracellular. In intracellular, break down of food occurs within the
cells. In extracellular digestion, enzymes are secreted outside the cell into the gut cavity or lumen
where then digestion takes place.
(c) Absorption is the uptake of the difusible food molecules from the digestive region across the
membrane in to the cell or into the blood stream.
(d) Assimilation is the utilization of the products of digestion for production of energy or
synthesis of cellular material.
(e) Egestionis the elimination of undigested matter from the body.

Digestion in Amoeba
Amoeba proteus has intracellular mode of digestion and feeds on many kinds of tiny organisms
which live with it in fresh water ponds and shallow lakes. Amoeba also feeds on particulate organic
matter. Food may be ingested at any points on the surface of the body. When Amoeba comes in
contact with food particle, it immediately puts out pseudopodia around it. These pseudopodia fuse
together around the food particle forming the food vacuole (Fig. 12.7). If the food particle is too
big, such as Paramecium, Amoeba encircles it, thus forming a large food vacuole. The food vacuole
undergoes many changes as digestion proceeds. First it grows smaller, then larger and again
smaller. Lysosomes, which contain hydrolytic enzymes, fuse with the food vacuole and enzymes
are secreted into it. The irst phase of digestion is killing and softening of food that take place
in the acidic medium (approximately pH 5.6) and later it becomes alkaline (about pH 7.3) during
which digestion is completed. When digestion is complete in food vacuole membrane is drawn
into numerous ine canals. The products of digestion are passed into the canals and inally into
the surrounding cytoplasm and subsequently utilized in various metabolic reactions of the animal.
Undigested matter is voided from the organism in the surrounding water by egestion at any point
of its surface (Fig. 12.8).

Digestion in Hydra
Hydra is an aquatic, diploblastic cnidarian. it has vase-like body composed of two principal layers of
cells. The central cavity of the body functions as a digestive cavity. The animal has only one opening
to the outside called mouth which is surrounded by mobile tentacles. The digestive cavity of this
sort is called gastrovascular cavity or coelenteron (Fig. 12.9a).

Fig. 12.9. Hydra: (a) Longitudinal section showing the detail of wall and the gastrovascular cavity (b) neniatocysts (discharged and
un-discharged)
Embedded in the tentacles are numerous stinging cells called nematocysts. Each nematocyst
consists of a hollow thread coiled within a capsule and a tiny hair-like trigger, projecting outside
(Fig. 12.9 b).
When a prey such as Daphnia or Cyclops comes in contact with the cnidocil the hollow thread of the
nematocyst turns inside out, ejects poison and the prey is paralysed or some times killed. Hydra
then grasps its prey with its tentacles and pushes it into the digestive cavity through open mouth.
The glandular cells in the gastrodermis secrete enzymes which start extracellular digestion.
Gastrodermal lagellate cells and contraction of body cavity help in mixing food with enzymes
and breaking up into ine particles. These ine particles are then engulfed by phagocytic action of
gastrodermal cells where digestion is completed intracellularly in the digestive vacuoles. Indigestible
food is expelled out from the gastrovascular cavity via mouth. Such a digestive system is called saclike digestive system having a common opening for ingestion and egestion.

Digestion in Planaria
Planaria is free-living, latworm found in fresh water streams and ponds. There is a single gut opening,
the mouth which is located on the ventral surface near the middle of the animal. The mouth opens
into a muscular tubular pharynx, which leads into the intestine. The intestine then immediately
divides into three branches - an anterior one, extending forward and two lateral branches. Each
of these main branches gives of numerous small branches which end blindly called caecae (Fig.
12.10).

Planaria engulfs the prey by protruding eversible pharynx through the mouth and pushes it into
the gastrovascular cavity. Food is then digested in the intestine. Enzymes are secreted by the gland
cells of the intestine and continue the process of extracellular digestion. Small particles of food are
inally engulfed by phagocytic cells. Digestion is completed intracellularly, from where the products
of digestion pass to the rest of the body ,by the process of difusion. Branched intestine also
facilitates difusion of materials in to body cells. Undigested food is egested through the mouth.
Digestion in Cockroach
The digestive system of cockroach is of tubular type. It can be divided into fore, mid and hind gut.
The foregut includes mouth cavity, pharynx, crop and gizzard. A pair of salivary glands is present in
the thorax region of the animal. They secrete saliva, which is poured into the mouth cavity. The mid
gut is a short narrow tube called mesenteron stomach. Short inger like hollow tubes, the hepatic
caecae open into the anterior end of the midgut.
The hind gut is a long coiled tube, the terminal part of which is a thick walled chamber, the rectum,
which opens to the exterior through anus (Fig. 12.11).

The cockroach feeds on all types of food. After cutting the food into small pieces with the help of
mandibles, it is mixed up with saliva in the mouth cavity. The digestive enzymes of saliva hydrolyse
the starchy matter contained in food. The partly digested food is stored in the crop. Food leaves the
crop chunk by chunk and after being ground in the gizzard it moves into the midgut. The enzymatic
secretions of hepatic caecae and midgut digest the food completely. The indigestible food after
temporary storage in the rectum, as fecal matter is then egested out through anus.

Digestion in Man
The digestive system of man consists of a long coiled tube that extends from the mouth to the
anus. The main parts in the direction of passage of food, are the oral or buccal cavity, esophagus,
stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum), large intestine (ascending colon,
transverse colon, descending colon, caecum and rectum). (Fig. 12.12) Associated with the
various regions are the glands, especially salivary glands, liver and pancreas. There are three
sites of digestion in the digestive system of man - oral cavity, stomach and small intestine.
 Fig. 12.12 The digestive system of man.
Digestion in Oral Cavity There are several functions of the oral cavity, the most obvious being
the (a) selection of food, (b) grinding or mastication (c) lubrication and (d) digestion.
Selection of food: When food enters the oral cavity (the cavity bounded by palate, tongue, teeth
and cheeks) it is tasted, smelled and felt. If the taste or smell is unpleasant or if hard objects like
19
12. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
bone or dirt are present in the food, it is rejected. Oral cavity is aided in selection by the senses of
smell, taste and sight. Tongue being sensory and muscular organ plays the most important role in
selection of food through its taste buds.
Grinding or mastication: After selection, the food is ground by means of molar teeth into
smaller pieces. This is useful because : (a) the esophagus allows relatively small pieces to pass
through and (b) small pieces have much more surface for the enzyme to attack.
Lubrication and digestion: These are the main functions of the oral cavity accomplished by
saliva. Saliva is secreted by three pairs of salivary glands namely sublingual glands situated below
the tongue; submaxillary glands behind the jaws and parotid glands in front of the ears. Saliva
produced by these glands contains three important ingredients.
i) Water and mucus, ii) Sodium bicarbonate and some other salts, iii) Carbohydrate digesting
enzymes, amylase or ptyalin.
Water and mucus together make a slimy liquid which serves to moisten and lubricate the food so
that it can be chewed eiciently and passed through the esophagus smoothly.
Sodium bicarbonate and some other salts are slightly antiseptic but their main function is to stablilze
the pH of food. Fresh saliva is alkaline with a pH nearly 8, quickly loses carbon dioxide and gets to
pH 6. Ptyalin is a carbohydrate - digesting enzyme, which digests starch and glycogen to maltose.
Swallowing: As a result of mastication, the softened, partly digested, slimy food mass is rolled
into small oval lump called bolus, which is then pushed to the back of the mouth by the action of
tongue and muscles of phaynx which ensure that the food does not enter the windpipe. Following
are the events which occur during swallowing:
i) the tongue moves upwards and backwards against the roof of the mouth, forcing the bolus to
 the back of the mouth cavity.
ii) The backward movement of the tongue pushes the soft palate up and closes the nasal opening
 at the back. At the same time the tongue forces the epiglottis (a lap of cartilage) into more or
 less horizontal position thus closing the opening of the windpipe (the glottis).
20
12. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1

Fig, 12.13 Swallowing in man
iii) The larynx, cartilage round the top of the windpipe moves upward under the back of the tongue.
iv) The glottis is partly closed by the contraction of a ring of muscle.
v) The food does not enter the partly open glottis, because the epiglottis diverts the food mass to
 one side of the opening and safely down the esophagus. The beginning of the swallowing action
 is voluntary, but once the food reaches the back of the mouth, swallowing becomes automatic.
 The food is then forced down the esophagus by peristalsis (Fig. 12.13).
Peristalsis These are characteristic movements of the digestive tract by which food is moved along
the cavity of the canal. It consists of the wave of contraction of the circular and longitudinal muscles
preceded by the wave of relaxation thus squeezing the food down along the canal. Peristalsis starts
just behind the mass of food from the buccal cavity along the esophagus to the stomach and then
along the whole alimentary canal (Fig. 12.14). Occasionally, the movements are reversed, with the
result food may be passed from the intestine back into the stomach and even into the mouth.
This movement is called antiperistalsis, leading to vomiting. Hunger contractions are peristaltic
contractions which are increased by low blood glucose levels and are suiciently strong to create
an uncomfortable sensation often called a “hunger pang”. Hunger pangs usually begin 12 to 24
hours after the previous meal or in less time for some people.
21
12. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Fig. 12.14 Diferent stages of
peristaltic movement in the
esophagus.
Digestion in stomach
At the junction between esophagus and the stomach there is a special ring of muscles called cardiac
sphincter. When the sphincter muscles contract, the entrance to the stomach closes and thus
prevents the contents of the stomach from moving back into the esophagus (Fig. 12.15a). It opens
when a wave of peristalsis coming down the esophagus reaches it.
The stomach is situated below the diaphragm on the left side of the abdominal cavity. It is an elastic
muscular bag that stores food from meals for some time, making discontinuous feeding possible.
It also partly digests the food.
Gravity assist the movement of
material through the esophagus,
especially when liquids are
swallowed. However, the peristaltic
contractions that move material
through the esophagus are
suiciently forceful to allow a
person to swallow, even while doing
a headstand.

Heart burn, or Pyrosis, is a

The stomach wall is composed of three principal layers: an outer layer of connective tissue; middle
layer of smooth muscles and inner layer (mucosa) of connective tissue with many glands. The
middle layer of muscles consists of outer longitudinal and inner circular muscles (Fig. 12.15 b).
These muscular layers help in churning and mixing the food with the stomach secretions. The
mucosa of the stomach possesses numerous tubular gastric glands,which are composed of three
kinds of cells;
a) mucous cells, that secrete mucus, b) parietal or oxyntic
cells secrete hydrochloric acid and c) zymogen cells,
which secrete pepsinogen (Fig. 12.15c). The secretion
of all these cells is collectively called gastric juice. The
secretion of the gastric juice is regulated by smell, sight
and quality of food.
Mucus is a thick secretion that covers the inside of the stomach. It prevents the underlying walls
from being digested.
Hydrochloric acid is secreted in concentrated form. It adjusts the pH of stomach contents ranging
from 2-3 for the pepsin to act on proteins. It also softens the food and kills many microorganisms
taken in along with the food.
Animation 12.7: Stomach Digestion

If more protein is present in the food it stimulates
the production of gastrin hormone from the gastric
endocrine lining, which is carried by blood to the
gastric glands and stimulates them to produce
more gastric juice. Thus more proteins more
gastrin and more gastric juice for digestion.
24
12. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Pepsin is an enzyme secreted in an inactive form called pepsinogen. Pepsinogen is activated to
pepsin when exposed to the acidic medium or to some already activated pepsin. Pepsin hydrolyzes
protein to yield peptones and polypeptides.
The muscles of stomach wall thoroughly mix up the food with gastric juice and eventually convert it
to semi-solid mass called chyme. Gradually the stomach empties into the duodenum through the
relaxed pyloric sphincter.
Digestion in small intestine
Small intestine in man consists of duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Duodenum is about 20-25 cm
long, which leads into jejunum and then
ileum. When chyme passes from stomach
into duodenum, its acidity stimulates the
release of secretions from pancreas, liver
and duodenal cells.
Pancreas is a large gland whose exocrine tissue secretes a juice that lows through pancreatic duct
into the duodenum. Included in this juice are enzymes that digest all principal components of food
i.e. carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrate- digesting enzyme is pancreatic amylase also
called amylopsin, which digests starch into maltose. Fat digesting enzyme is lipase, that hydrolyzes
a small percentage of fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Like pepsin, trypsin is also secreted as
inactive trypsinogen, which is activated by enterokinase, an enzyme secreted by the lining of the
duodenum.
Hepatic and Pancreatic secretions are also stimulated by a hormone
called secretin, which is produced by the intestinal mucosa on the entry
of acidic food from stomach. The acidity stimulates secretin production
in duodenum and secretin is carried by blood to pancreas which is
stimulated to produce pancreatic juice. Secretin also inhibits gastric
secretion.

Trypsin splits proteins into peptones and polypeptides. Pancreatic juice also contains sodium
bicarbonate, which partly neutralizes the chyme coming from the stomach. This is necessary
because enzymes of the pancreas do not work well in acid conditions.
Liver secretes bile, which may be temporarily stored in the gall bladder and released into the
duodenum through the bile duct. The bile is green, watery luid. It contains no enzymes, but its
green colour is due to the bile pigments, which are formed from the breakdown of hemoglobin in
the liver. The bile also contains bile salts, which act on fats, and emulsiies them. It means that they
break them up into small globules, which are then easily digested by water-soluble lipase.
If bile pigments are prevented from leaving digestive
tract, they may accumulate in blood, causing a
condition known as jaundice. Cholesterol, secreted
by the liver, may precipitate in the gall bladder to
produce gall stones, which may block release of
bile.

The liver is easily ruptured because it is large, ixed in
position, and fragile or it may lacerate by a broken rib.
Liver rupture or laceration may result in severe internal
bleeding. The liver may become enlarged as a result of heart
malfunctioning, hepatic cancer or may be damaged due to
hepatitis or being alcoholic.

Jejunum is the second portion of the small intestine extending from the duodenum to the ileum.
It is about 2.4 meter in length comprising about two ifth of the small intestine. Lower three ifth of
the small intestine from jejunum is the ileum.
The food, which escapes undigested from the duodenum, is completely digested in the jejunum
and ileum by a group of enzymes contained in the intestinal juice. The overall picture of enzymes in
the human digestive system, their substrates and inal products is as follows.
Enzymes Substrates Products
Amino peptidase polypeptides dipeptides
Erypsin dipeptides amino acids
Lipase fats fatty acids and glycerol
Maltase maltose glucose
Lactase lactose glucose and galactose
Absorption of food
As we know that small intestine consists of duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Nearly all absorption
of the products of digestion takes place in the ileum. The internal surface of ileum has many folds,
which exhibit velvety appearance due to the presence of numerous inger-like outgrowths called
villi ( Fig. 12.17 a & b). Each villus is richly supplied with blood capillaries and a vessel called lacteal
of lymphatic system with a covering of epithelial cells. Electron microscope reveals that these cells
have countless, closely packed cylindrical processes, microvilli (Fig. 12.17 c). The total area of
absorption becomes incredibly large due to the enfolding, villi and microvilli. Simple Sugars and
amino acids are absorbed by difusion or active transport into the blood capillaries through the
microvilli. Some of the fatty acids and glycerol are also absorbed into blood stream. However, a
large proportion of fatty acids and glycerol enter the epithelial cells of villi, where they recombine
into fats. These fats then enter the lacteals. Proteins present in lymph vessels combine with fat
molecules to form lipoprotein droplets. These pass
into blood stream via thoracic lymphatic duct. The lipoproteins are subsequently hydrolysed by blood plasma
enzyme and enter body cells, where they may be used
in respiration or stored as fat in the liver, muscle of
under the skin.
Many humans develop intestinal gas and diarrhoea
from consuming milk product, because they lack the
enzymes for digesting lactose in milk. The epithelial
cells of villi are constantly shed into intestine. These
cells are replaced by the new cells moving up due to
rapid cell division in crypts (Fig. 12.17)

The intestinal contents are pushed along the alimentary canal by normal peristaltic activity. At the
end of ileum, there is an ileocolic sphincter that opens and closes time to time to allow a small
amount of residue from the ileum to enter the large intestine.
Large intestine : The large intestine is composed of a caecum, colon and rectum. Caecum is a
blind sac that projects from the large intestine between ileum and colon. From the blind end of the
caecum there arises a inger like process called appendix. The appendix, some times gets inlamed
due to entrapping and then puriication of food causing appendicitis, which has to be removed
surgically in many instances.

The material that passes from the small intestine to the large intestine contains a large amount
of water, dissolved salts and undigested material. Water and salts are absorbed into blood, while
undigested material is rejected as feces. The fecal matter contains a large number of bacteria, plant
ibers, slouged of mucosal cells, mucus, cholesterol, bile pigments and water. Large intestine also
harbors a large population of useful bacteria that synthesize some vitamins especially vitamin K,
which are absorbed in blood. If the absorption of water and salts does not take place due to infection,
drug action or emotional disturbance, a condition known as diarrhoea occurs. If this condtion
is unchecked, dehydration develops that may prove to be fatal. The other extreme condition is
constipation, which is caused by the excessive absorption of water.

Rectum is the last part of large intestine, where feces are temporarily stored and rejected through
anus, at intervals. Anus is surrounded by two sphincters, the internal is of smooth and outer of
striped muscles. Under normal condtions, as the rectum is illed up with feces, it gives rise to
defecation relex. This relex can be consciously inhibited in individuals other than infants. Gradually
the child learns to bring this relex under control.

SOME COMMON DISEASES RELATED TO NUTRITION
Dyspepsia
Incomplete or imperfect digestion is called dyspepsia. This is not a disease in itself but symptomatic
of other disorders or diseases. This is characterized by abdominal discomfort, latulence, heartburn,
nausea and vomiting. These symptoms may occur irregularly and in diferent patterns from time to
time. Dyspepsia may occur due to excessive acidity in stomach or faulty function of stomach and
intestine or insuicient quality or quantity of bile secretions.

Food poisoning
This term indicates an illness from indigestion of food containing toxic substances. One of the
commonest causes of food poisoning are the toxins produced by bacteria, Salmonella and
Campylobacter. These bacteria live in the intestines of cattle, chicken and duck without causing
disease symptoms. Humans, however, may develop food poisoning if they drink milk, eat meat or
eggs which are contaminated with these bacteria. The symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhoea,
vomiting and abdominal pain. They occur from 12-24 hours after eating contaminated food.
Infection is most likely, if unpasteurized milk is drunk or if meat is not properly cooked.
The liquid that escapes during defrosting frozen meat contains Salmonella bacteria. The dishes and
utensils while the meat is defrosting must not be allowed to come in contact with any other food.
A severe form of food poisoning is botulism. This is caused by toxins produced by bacteria known as
Clostridium botulinum. Botulism develops by the use of improperly canned or otherwise preserved
foods, especially meat. The toxin produced by these bacteria is very powerful and has selective
action on central nervous system, causing cardiac and respiratory paralysis. The early symptoms
of this diseases are fatigue, dizziness, double vision, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and
abdominal pain.
Obesity
It is the term employed when a person has abnormal amount of fat on the body. If one eats too
much food than body requirement, the surplus is stored as fat so becomes overweight or obese.
There is fat stored in adipose tissue in the abdomen, around the kidneys and under the skin.
Certain cells accumulate drops of fat in their cytoplasm. As these drops increase in size and number,
they join together to form one large globule of fat in the middle of the cell, pushing the cytoplasm
into thin layer and the nucleus to one side. Groups of fat cells form adipose tissue. Some people
never seem to get fat no matter how much they eat, while others lay down fat when their intake
only just exceeds their need. The explanation probably lies in the balance of hormones which, to
some extent, is determined by heredity. An obese person is much more likely to sufer from high
blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stomach disorder than a person who has normal
body weight.
Anorexia Nervosa
This term is employed to the loss of appetite due to the fear of becoming obese. Such a feeling is
common in human females between the age of 12 and 21 years. Fear does not diminish even when
weight is dropped to dangerous level. Psychiatric therapy is usually required when patient refuses
to eat.
33
12. Nutrition eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Anorexia is an illness which largely afects girls usually just after the onset of puberty. The illness
is characterized by the loss of appetite due to the fear of becoming obese. An anorexic girl over
estimates the size of her own body and so insists that she is over weight when in reality her weight
has dropped to a dangerous level. These girls are often immature psychologically and unable to cope
with the challenges of puberty and their emerging sexuality. The loss of feminine characteristics
enable the girls to retreat into a child like state in which they feel safe. Psychiatric therapy is usually
required to treat anorexic girls. Such patients are fed through any route other than alimentary
canal that is intramuscularly or intravenously. The recovery is very slow. It may take 2-4 years and
in some cases longer.
Bulimia Nervosa
It is neurotic disorder in slightly older girls. It is characterized by bouts of over eating fattening
food such as fried food or cream cakes. This voracious eating is followed immediately by selfinduced vomiting, fasting or purgatives. The frequent vomiting and purging may cause physical
efects including serum electrolyte imbalance and frequent recurring infections. Treatment of
bulimics is likely to be prolonged. The initial treatment is to overcome the efects of weight loss and
malnutrition. It is necessary to undertake the treatment in hospital under strict supervision.
Piles
Piles or hemorrhoids are masses of dilated, tortuous veins in the anorectal mucosa. These masses
may some times start bleeding during bowel movements. Situation may aggravate when the patient
sufers from constipation. The urge to defecate is depressed and it becomes diicult to expel the
faeces. This may cause other symptoms of ill health because of the physical distension of therectum. The only therapy required is the improvement of the hygiene and the use of food softeners,
such as roughage, in food or laxatives. The patients are advised not to sit on hard seats. Depending
on severity of the symptoms, sometimes the hemorrhoids have to be removed surgically
Ulcer
The inner wall of digestive tract is normally covered with mucus, which protects it from enzymes.
When the mucus layer breaks down the digestive enzymes begin to eat away the walls of stomach
or duodenum. This results in a sore called ulcer. Occasionally, an ulcer is so severe that a hole
develops in the wall of the digestive tract and the contents of the tract spill into the abdominal
cavity, leading to severe infections which may prove to be fatal, if immediate medical care is not
sought.
Excessive secretion of gastric acid secretion is an important factor of peptic ulcer. Smoking, spicy
food, alcoholic beverages, cofee, tea and stress should be avoided by the patients sufering from
ulcer.

NEED OF RESPIRATORY GAS EXCHANGE
At all levels of activities in living organisms an uninterrupted supply of energy is required. Respiration
is one of the most important metabolic activities of all organisms. Respiration occurs at two levels, i.e,
organismic and cellular level. Organismic respiration is also known as breathing or ventilation. The
cellular respiration is directly involved in the production of energy, necessary for all living activities.
Cellular respiration is the process by which cell utilizes oxygen, produces carbon dioxide, extracts and
conserves the energy from food molecules in biologically useful form, such as, ATP.
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF
GAS EXCHANGE IN AIR AND IN WATER
Exchange of gases during organismic respiration is carried out only by difusion. Respiratory gases
are exchanged between body luid and outside medium which may be water or air. There is no active
transport mechanism to move respiratory gases across biological membranes. For that matter, air is
better respiratory’ medium than water. Oxygen can be obtained more easily from air than from water
because of many reasons.
Firstly, the oxygen content of air is much higher than the oxygen content of equal volume of water. A
liter of water cannot contain even 10 ml of oxygen whereas oxygen content of fresh air is about 200 ml
per liter. Secondly, oxygen difuses about 8000 times more quickly in air than in water.
Breathing or ventilation is directly involved in the exchange of gases .The ventilation of water is far
more diicult than the ventilation of air, because water is 8000 times more dense than air .In terms
of viscosity the water is 50 times more viscous, which makes it more diicult for exchange of gases as
compared to air.

GASEOUS EXCHANGE IN PLANTS
Plants like animals also get their energy from respiration. In plants, in contrast to animals, no special
organ or system is present for gaseous exchange as they exist in higher animals. Every cell of plant
carries out exchange of gases according to its needs. The transport system of plants which includes
conducting tissues i.e. xylem and phloem is not involved in the transport of gases in the plants.
In most cells of mesophyll which are specialized for photosynthesis, there are present large air
spaces. These air spaces are directly involved in gaseous exchange. Stomata are the main sites of
exchange of gases in plants. Stomata are largely present in the leaves and in young stem. In older
stems, cork tissue is present which is formed of dead cells. The cork tissue has special pores called
lenticels which are involved in gaseous exchange. Land plants get their oxygen directly from air which
enters through stomata. Enormous number of stomata are. present on the leaves. It is estimated
that there are 12000 stomata per square centimeter of leaf surface in Tobacco plant. These stomata
lead to the intercellular spaces (spaces between cells) of mesophyll tissue. The air spaces are
comparable to honey comb. These
air spaces may comprise up to 40%
of the total volume of the leaf. The
exchange of gases between and the
moist surface of mesophyll cells
takes place promptly (Fig 13.1). The
roots of the land plants get their
oxygen from the air existing in the
spaces between the soil particles.
Aquatic plants obtain their oxygen
by difusion from dissolved oxygen
in water.

Photorespiration and its Consequences
Respiratory activity which occurs in plants during daytime is called photorespiration. In the process
of photorespiration carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is absorbed. The oxygen absorbed is
not useful to produce energy such as ATP. In other words photorespiration is a light dependent
process during which oxygen is absorbed and carbon dioxide is released. This oxygen is derived
from the early reaction of photosynthesis.
The photorespiration is a process in which ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco)
ixes oxygen instead of carbon dioxide which results in lowering the overall rate of carbon dioxide
ixation and plant growth.
Ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate (RuBP) reacts with oxygen in photorespiration
The irst step of photorespiration during which RuBP reacts with oxygen is carried out by rubisco,
the most abundant protein in chloroplasts and probably the most abundant protein in the world.
The rubisco is carboxylase as well as oxygenase. When rubisco acts as carboxylase it adds carbon
dioxide to RuBP, which is an accepter molecule. On the other hand when rubisco is oxygenase
it adds oxygen to RuBP. Both these reactions compete with each other. When RuBP reacts with
oxygen, a two carbon compound glycolate is produced.
 RuBP + O2
 8 Glycolate
The glycolate thus produced difuses into the membrane bounded organelles known as peroxisomes.
In the peroxisomes the glycolate is converted into glycine, through a series of reactions.
 Glycolate 8 glycine
The glycine is the simplest amino acid which soon after its formation difuses into the mitochondria
where two glycine molecules are converted into serine and synthesis a molecule of carbon dioxide
is formed.
 2 glycine 8 serine + CO2
5
13. Gaseous Exchange eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The pathway in which RuBP is converted into serine is called photorespiration. The process of
photorespiration uses ATP and NADPH produced in the light reactions just like Calvin-Benson
cycle. But, in fact, photorespiration is reverse of Calvin cycle. During photorespiration carbon
dioxide is released instead of ixation into carbohydrates. In most plants photorespiration reduces
the amount of carbon ixed into -carbohydrates by 25%.
In a hot and dry day the level of oxygen inside the leaf rises. This is because the stomata close to
prevent the loss of water. The level of carbon dioxide falls because it is being consumed and the
level of oxygen rises because closed stomata do not let it go out.
It is interesting that apparently the photorespiration reduces the photosynthetic process and it is
not essential for plants and many plants grow normally without the process of photorespiration. It
is also observed that if photorespiration is inhibited chemically, the plant can, still grow. Then why
does photorespiration exist? The common simple answer to this question is that the active site of
rubisco is evolved to bind both carbon dioxide and oxygen together. Originally it was not a problem
as there was little oxygen in the atmosphere and the carbon dioxide binding activity was the only
one used. The photorespiration started when the quantity of oxygen became more.
RESPIRATORY ORGANS IN REPRESENTATIVE
AQUATIC AND TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS
 Properties of respiratory surfaces in animals
Respiratory surfaces in animals are the sites where gaseous exchange takes place. The respiratory
surfaces in most animals exhibit the following features :
1. Large surface and moisture:
The surface area should be extremely large and kept moist as it is seen in the lungs in the land
vertebrates and in the gills in the case of ishes.
2. Thin epithelium:
The distance across which difusion has to take place should be little. In most animals the epithelium
which separates air and blood is only two cell thick. As a result the distance for difusion is very
short.
6
13. Gaseous Exchange eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
3. Ventilation:
Ventilation maintains a steep difusion gradient. There is
a big diference in the concentration of the gases at two
points which brings about difusion.
4. Capillary network:
The respiratory site should possess extensive network of
capillaries through which blood should low all the ime at
an adequate speed. In this way steep difusion gradient is
maintained which helps in rapid difusion of oxygen.
Respiration in Hydra
Hydra has no specialized organs for respiration. Exchange
of gases i.e., intake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide,
occurs through the entire general surface in contact with
water. Exchange of oxygen in and carbon dioxide out also
occurs in cells lining the digestive cavity. In this way the
surface lining of the enteron acts., as an eicient respiratory
surface (Fig. 13.2).

Respiration in Earthworm
Although earthworm is much complex than hydra, yet it does not have any specialized respiratory
organs. The exchange of gases occurs mainly through skin. Skin is richly supplied with blood capillaries
and is always kept moist by the secretion of epidermal mucous gland cells and also by coelomic
luid exuding out through the dorsal pores. Oxygen dissolved on the wet surface passes through
the cuticle and epidermal cells into the blood. In the blood, oxygen combines with haemoglobin
to form oxyhaemoglobin.Oxyhaemoglobin releases up oxygen at the tissue level. In earthworm,
blood does not come into direct contact with tissue cells so oxygen must difuse through the tissue
luids and coelomic luids. Carbon dioxide is removed from the tissues by the blood and carried in
the plasma to skin, from where it is excreted ((Fig. 13.3)

RESPIRATION IN COCKROACH
Cockroach has specialized organs for respiration. The respiratory system of the cockroach is very
specialized. It consists of branching systems of air tubules called tracheae lined by chitin. The main
tracheal trunk communicates with exterior by 10 pairs of apertures called spiracles, present on
the lateral sides of the body. Two pairs are in thorax while the rest eight are in each of the eight
9
13. Gaseous Exchange eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
abdominal segments. The main tracheae divide
and subdivide forming very ine thin-walled
tubules called tracheoles. These tracheoles end
into blind ducts partly illed with luid, in which
the oxygen dissolves. These surround the organs
and the tissues and directly supply oxygen to the
living cells. A concentration gradient is set up
between them and the spiracular openings and
oxygen difuses into the trachea from the outside
air. The movement of the air through the tracheal
trunks transfers gases through inspiration and
expiration. Air is pumped in and out of the
tracheae by the expansion and contraction of
the abdominal muscles (Dorsoventral muscles).
When abdomen expands, the irst four pairs
of spiracles open, air rushes in through these
spiracles into tracheoles. Abdomen contracts, the
anterior four pairs of spiracles close and posterior
six pairs of spiracles open. This forces air through
the tubes and eventually out of the body. In this
way exhalation and inhalation take place. From
the spiracles air enters into trachea and then
tracheole, from where gaseous exchange between
tissue cells and air in tracheole takes place. Thus
air is directly supplied through tracheoles to the
tissue cells. Blood is not involved in transport of
gases(Fig.l3.4).

Respiration in ish
Fish respires through the gills which are paired structures present on either side of the body almost
at the junction of head and trunk. Gills are most efective and highly modiied for gaseous exchange
in aquatic animals. They are in four to ive pairs which may open through gill slits and are visible on
the surface of the pharynx (cartilaginous ish) or are placed in bronchial cavities which are covered
by operculum. Gills have great surface area for gaseous exchange. The gill surface is all the time
ventilated by constant low of water. Heart pumps the blood directly to the gills from where
oxygenated blood is carried to all the parts of the body. The deoxygenated blood from diferent
parts of the body is received by heart. The heart of the ish is single circuit and the blood lows in
only one direction. The blood enters the posterior side of heart and after passing through diferent
chambers it is pumped into the gills. Water enters through the mouth and after passing over the
gills move out of the body through the gill openings (Fig. 13.5)

Respiration in Frog
In frog, the gaseous exchange occurs through the lungs, by skin, and buccal chamber which are
richly supplied with blood vessels. The gaseous exchange through the skin is known as cutaneous
respiration.
Gaseous exchange through the lungs is called pulmonary respiration. In frog the air enters
through the nostrils, when the nostrils are open; the mouth is closed. After entry of air the nostrils
close, the loor of buccal cavity is raised, air is pushed into the lungs. This intake of air is known as
inhalation or inspiration. Expiration occurs exactly in reverse order in sequence of inspiration.

Lungs in frog are simple sacs almost like balloon when they are fully expanded. The inner surface
of lung is increased by thin walled air chambers. The walls of these air chambers are richly supplied
with capillaries. These blood containing areas in the lungs are the main sites for gaseous exchange.
The consumed air after gaseous exchange moves out of the lungs through the nostrils. The removal
of consumed air out of the lungs, after gaseous exchange has occurred, is called exhalation or
expiration (Fig. 13.6).
Respiration in birds
Respiratory system in birds is the most eicient and elaborate. The birds are very active animals
with high metabolic rate, and thus need large amount of oxygen. The respiratory system in the birds
is so arranged that there is one way low of the air through the lungs and the air is renewed after
inspiration. In the lungs of birds, tiny thin walled ducts called parabronchi are present instead of
alveoli. These parabronchi are open at both ends and the air; is constantly ventilated. The walls of the
parabronchi are chief sites of gaseous
exchange. The direction of the blood
low in the lungs is opposite to that of the
air low through the parabronchi. This
counter current exchange increases the
amount of oxygen which enters blood.
Lungs in birds are very eicient in this
respect as well, because no stale of air
remains in the parabronchi.
The lungs have also developed several
extensions known as air sacs which reach
all parts of the body and even penetrate
some of the bones. In most birds the air
sacs are nine in number which become
inlated by air at atmospheric pressure
when the rib articulations are rotated
forward and upward. The inlated air
sacs act as bellows and send air into the
parabronchi for gaseous exchange.

Respiration in man
In man respiratory system includes lungs and air passages which are responsible for carrying fresh
air to the respiratory sites.
Air Passage Ways
Air passage ways consist of nostrils, nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles
and alveolar ducts which ultimately lead into the alveolar sac. Nasal cavities are lined with mucous
membrane of ciliated epithelium. Each nasal cavity is subdivided into three passage ways by the
projection of bones from the walls of the internal nose. Air enters the nasal cavity through nostril
and the larger dust particles are trapped by the hair and mucus in the nostrils. Air, while passing
through the nasal cavity, becomes moist, warm and iltered of smaller foreign particles by mucous

V: 1.1
membrane. The nasal cavity leads into the throat or pharynx by two internal openings. The pharynx
is a muscular passage lined with mucous membrane. The air is channelized from the pharynx into
the larynx.
The larynx or voice box is a complex cartilaginous structure surrounding the upper end of the
trachea. One of the cartilages, the epiglottis has a muscularly controlled, hinge-like action and
serves as a lid which automatically covers the opening of the larynx during the act of swallowing so
as to prevent the entry of food or liquids into the larynx. The opening of larynx is called glottis and
is also lined with mucous membrane. In the glottis the mucous membrane is stretched across into
two thin edged ibrous bands called vocal cords, which help in voice production, when vibrated by
air.
Fig. 13.8 Events in the throat associated with breathing (a) and swallowing (b). The commonly held belief that the epiglottis closes
downward upon the larynx when food is swallowed is not quite true. The closure is probably never complete; the degree of closure
is determined partly by the backward movement of the tongue during swallowing (which forces the epiglottis into a more or less
horizontal position) and partly by the upward movement of the larynx (which brings it up under the epiglottis). Food does not enter
the partly open larynx and obstruct breathing primarily because the epiglottis diverts the food mass to one side of the opening and
safely down the esophagus.
The trachea or wind Pipe is a tubular structure lying ventral to the oesophagus and extends to the
chest cavity or thorax where it is divided into right and left bronchi. In the wall of trachea there
are a series of C shaped cartilage rings which prevent the trachea from collapsing and keep the
passage of air open. Each bronchus on entering the lung divides and subdivides progressively into
16
13. Gaseous Exchange eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
smaller and smaller bronchi. When the smaller bronchi attain a diameter of one mm or less, then
they are called bronchioles. Bronchi have thesame cartilage rings as the trachea, but the rings are
progressively replaced by irregularly distributed cartilage plates and the bronchioles totally lack
cartilages. Bronchioles are made up of mainly circular smooth muscles.
The bronchioles continue to divide and subdivide deep into the lungs and inally open into a large
number of air-sacs. Air-sac is the functional unit of the lungs. Each air-sac consists of several
microscopic single layered structures called alveoli. Overlying the alveoli there is a rich network of
blood capillaries to produce an excellent site for the exchange of gases.
The lungs are closed sacs that are connected to the outside by way of the trachea and the nostrils
or mouth. Lungs are spongy because of the presence of millions of alveoli. Lungs are placed in
the chest cavity. Chest cavity is bounded by ribs and muscles on the sides. The loor of the chest is
called diaphragm.Diaphragm is a sheet of skeletal muscles. Lungs are covered with double layered
thin membranous sacs called pleura (Fig. 13.9).

MECHANICS OF VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY
REGULATION OF BREATHING IN MAN
Breathing is a process in which fresh air containing more oxygen is pumped into the lungs and air
with more carbon dioxide is pumped out of the lungs. In other words breathing is a mechanical
process consisting of two phases, inspiration and expiration. During inspiration, fresh air moves in
and in expiration air with low O2
 and high CO2
 content moves out of the lungs. During rest breathing

occurs rhythmically at the frequency of 15 to 20 times per minute in humans. To understand the
mechanism of breathing we should keep in mind three aspects related to lungs and associated
structures.
1. Lungs are spongy in nature. The lungs themselves neither pull air in nor can they push it out.
 During inspiration passive expansion of elastic lungs occurs and expiration is due to a passive
 contraction of lungs.
2. The loor of the chest cavity is diaphragm, which is a muscular sheet. The snape of the
 diaphragm is more domelike when its muscles are relaxed. On the other hand when the
 muscles of the diaphragm contract its shape becomes less domelike.
3. Walls of the chest cavity are composed of ribs and intercostal muscles. When muscles between
 the ribs contract, the ribs are elevated and when muscles between ribs are relaxed the ribs
 settle down.
Inspiration
During inspiration the space inside the chest cavity is increased in two ways. Firstly, the muscles of
ribs contract and elevate the ribs upwards and forwards and secondly, the muscles of diaphragm

19
13. Gaseous Exchange eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
also contract and diaphragm becomes less domelike. This downward movement of diaphragm
and outward and upward movement of the ribs causes increase in the chest cavity and reduces
pressure. When the pressure from the lungs is removed they expand. With the expansion of the
lungs vacuum is created inside the lungs in which the air rushes from the outside due to higher
atmospheric pressure. This is called inspiration (Fig. 13.10,13.11)
Expiration
During expiration the muscles of ribs are relaxed and the ribs move downward and inward. In
this way from the sides of chest cavity the space becomes less. At the same time the muscles
of diaphragm also relax becoming more domelike
and the chest cavity is also reduced from the loor.
This reduction in space of the chest cavity exerts
pressure on the lungs. When lungs are pressed the
qir inside lungs moves out of the lungs and this is
expiration. (Fig. 13.10, 13.11)

 Fig. 13.11
In Premature infant, respiratory distress syndrome is
common, especially for infant with a gestation age of less
than 7 months. This occurs because enough surfactant
(mixture of lipoprotein molecules produced by the secretary
cells of the alveolar epithelium which forms a layer over the
surface of the luid within the alveoli to reduce the surface
tension) is not produced to reduce the tendency of the lungs
to collapse.
20
13. Gaseous Exchange eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
TRANSPORT OF RESPIRATORY GASES
Intake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide by blood passing through capillaries of alveoli is
brought about by the following factors.
1. Difusion of oxygen in and carbon dioxide out occurs because
 of diference in partial pressures of these gases.
2. Within the rich network of capillaries surrounding the alveoli,
 blood is distributed in extremely thin layers and, therefore,
 exposed to large alveolar surface.
3. Blood in the lungs is separated from the alveolar air by extremely thin membranes of the
 capillaries and alveoli.
Transport of Oxygen
In human beings the respiratory pigment is haemoglobin. It is contained in the red blood corpuscles.
Haemoglobin readily combines with oxygen to form bright red oxyhaemoglobin. Oxyhaemoglobin
is unistable and splits into the normal purple-red coloured haemoglobin and oxygen in the
conditions of low oxygen concentration and less pressure.Carbonic anhydrase enzyme present in
R.B.C. facilitates this activity. In this way haemoglobin acts as an eicient oxygen carrier. A small
proportion of oxygen also gets dissolved in the blood plasma.
 Hb + O2 m HbO2
Haemoglobin can absorb maximum oxygen at the sea level. The maximum amount of oxygen
which normal human blood absorbs and carries at the sea-level is about 20ml/100ml of blood. This
is the maximum capacity of haemoglobin for oxygen when it is fully oxygenated. Under normal
conditions, blood of alveoli of the lungs is not completely oxygenated. When an oxygen tension is
115mm mercury, haemoglobin is 98 percent saturated and, therefore, contains 19.6 ml of oxygen
per 100ml of blood. This means that haemoglobin can be almost completely oxygenated by an
oxygen pressure of 100 mm mercury, which is present in the lungs. Any higher oxygen pressure
would have the same result. When oxygen pressure falls below 60 mm mercury, as in many cells and
tissues, the oxygen saturation of haemoglobin decreases very sharply. This results in the liberation
21
13. Gaseous Exchange eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
of large quantities of oxygen from haemoglobin. In
this way in the tissue where oxygen tension is low
oxyhaemoglobin dissociates rapidly.
There are three important factors which afect the capacity of haemoglobin to combine with oxygen.
1. Carbon dioxide
When carbon dioxide pressure increases, the oxygen tension decreases, the capacity of haemoglobin
to hold oxygen becomes less. In this way increased carbon dioxide tension favours the greater
liberation of oxygen from the blood to the tissue.
2. Temperature
Rise in temperature also causes a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, e.g., in the
increased muscular activity.
3. pH
The pH of blood also inluences the degree to which oxygen binds to haemoglobin. As the pH of the
blood declines, the amount of oxygen bound to haemoglobin also declines. This occurs because
decreased pH results from an increase in hydrogen ions, and the hydrogen ions combine with the
protein part of the haemoglobin molecules, causing a decrease in the ability of haemoglobin to
bind oxygen. Conversely, an increase in blood pH results in an increased ability of haemoglobin to
bind oxygen.
Transport of Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide is more soluble than oxygen and
dissolves freely in the tissue luid surrounding the
cells. From the tissue luid, dissolved carbon dioxide
passes to the plasma within the blood capillaries.
Carbon dioxide is transported in the blood in several diferent states.
1. Some of the carbon dioxide (about 20%) is carried as carboxyhaemoglobin. Carboxyhaemoglobin
is formed when carbon dioxide combines with amino group of haemoglobin.
2. Other plasma proteins also carry about 5% carbon dioxide from the body luids to the capillaries
of lungs.
As a scuba diver descends in the sea, the pressure of the
water on his body prevents normal expansion of the lungs.
To compensate, the diver breaths pressurized air from air
cylinders, which has a greater pressure than sea level air
pressure.
Carbon dioxide which is much more important than oxygen
as a regulator of normal alveoler ventilation (Breathing) but
under certain circumstances a reduced P02
 (partial pressure
of the oxygen) in the arterial blood does play an important
stimulatory role especially during conditions of shock.
22
13. Gaseous Exchange eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
3. About 70% carbon dioxide is carried as bicarbonate ion combined with sodium in the plasma. As
carbon dioxide from tissue luid enters the capillaries it combines to form carbonic acid.

When blood leaves the capillary bed most of the carbon dioxide is in the form of bicarbonate
ions. All these reactions are reversible. In the lungs bicarbonate ions combine with hydrogen ions
to form carbonic acid which splits into water and carbon dioxide. It is this carbon dioxide which
difuses out from the capillaries of the lungs into the space of alveolar sac.

4. Small amount of carbon dioxide is also carried by corpuscles combined with potassium.
Carbon Dioxide Concentration
in Arterial And Venous Blood
It has been found that arterial blood contains about 50 ml of carbon dioxide per 100 ml of blood
whereas venous blood has 54 ml of carbon dioxide per 100 ml of blood. In this way each 100 ml
of blood takes up just 4 ml of carbon dioxide as it passes through the tissues and gives of 4 ml of
carbon dioxide per 100 ml of blood as it passes through the lungs.
Respiratory Disorders
Cancer
Many problems in the respiratory system can take place if inside lining is exposed continuously
to unhealthy air, containing smoke and other pollutants. Lung cancer is one of the most serious
diseases of respiratory system. Cancer or carcinoma is basically malignant tumor of potentially
unlimited growth that expands locally by invasion and systemically by metastasis. Cancer can
occlude respiratory passages as the tumor replaces lung tissue. Smoking especially in young adults
is the most potential threat of lung cancer. The chances of lung cancer are ten times more in those
23

persons who smoke or live in smoky and congested areas as compared to those who do not smoke.
It is now estimated that 90% of lung cancer is caused by smoking. Recent research indicates that
more than ten compounds of tar of tobacco smoke are involved in causing cancer.
Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is a disorder of respiratory system. In fact, it is the general name of a group of diseases
caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pulmonary tuberculosis is a disease of lungs in which inside
of the lung is damaged resulting in cough and fever. It is more common in poor people. Malnutrition
and poor living conditions facilitate Mycobacterium to grow. The disease is curable with proper
medical attention. It is a contagious disease.
Asthma
Asthma is a serious respiratory disease associated with severe paroxysm of diicult breathing,
usually followed by a period of complete relief, with recurrence of attack at more or less frequent
intervals. It is an allergic reaction to pollen, spores, cold, humidity, pollution etc which manifests itself
by spasmodic contraction of small bronchiole tubes. Asthma results in the release of inlammatory
chemicals such as histamines into the circulatory system that cause severe contraction of the
bronchiole.
Emphysema
Emphysema is a break down of alveoli. This respiratory problem is more common among smokers.
The substances present in the smoke of the tobacco weaken the wall of alveoli. The irritant substances
of smoke generally cause “smoker’s cough” and
coughing bursts some of the weakened alveoli. In the
result of constant coughing the absorbing surface of
the lung is greatly reduced. The person sufering from
emphysema cannot oxygenate his blood properly and
least exertion makes him breathless and exhausted.
Emphysema produces increased airway resistance because the bronchioles are obstructed as a
result of inlammation and because damaged bronchioles collapse during expiration, trapping air
within the alveolar sacs.
Role of Respiratory Pigments
Various types of respiratory pigments are present in diferent animals. The pigment combines with
oxygen reversibly and increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. Haemoglobin is the most
In patients with emphysema, alveolar walls degenerate
and small alveoli combine to form larger alveoli. The result
is fewer alveoli, but alveoli with an increased volume and
decreased surface area. Although the enlarged alveoli
are still ventilated, there is inadequate surface area for
complete gas exchange, and the physiological dead air
space is increased.

important protein present in many animals including man. Haemoglobin in man increases the oxygen
carrying capacity of the blood to about 75 times. You are familiar with its chemical composition.
Myoglobin is haemoglobin-like iron-containipg protein pigment occurring in muscle ibers.
Myoglobin is also known as muscle haemoglobin. It serves as an intermediate compound for the
transfer of oxygen from haemoglobin to aerobic metabolic processes of the muscle cells. It can
also store some oxygen. Myoglobin consists of just one polypeptide chain associated with an ironcontaining ring structure which can bind with one molecule of oxygen. The ainity of myoglobins
to combine with oxygen is much higher as compared to haemoglobin.
Lung capacities
In an adult human being when the lungs are fully inlated the total inside capacity of lungs is about
5 litres. Normally when we are at rest or asleep the exchange is only about half a litre. The volume
of air taken inside the lungs and expelled during exercise is about 3.5 litres. In other words, there
is a residual volume of 1.5 litres even during exercise which cannot be expelled.
Normally, at rest we inhale and exhale 15-20 times per minute. During exercise the breathing rate
may rise to 30 times per minute. The increased rate and depth of breathing during exercise allows
more oxygen to dissolve in blood and supplied be to the active muscles. The extra carbon dioxide
which the muscle puts into the blood is removed by deep and fast breathing. There is a little change
in the composition of inhaled and exhaled air during rest or exercise in most of the constituents of
the air as seen in the Table 13.1
Diving relex
Aquatic mammals especially cetaceans can stay in the depth of the ocean for about two hours
without coming up for air.
Diving mammals have almost twice the volume of blood in relation to their body weight as
compared to non divers. Most of the diving mammals have high concentration of myoglobin in
their muscles. Myoglobin binds extra oxygen.
When a mammal dives to its limit the diving relex is activated. The breathing stops, the rate of
heart beat slows down to one tenth of the normal rate, theconsumption of oxygen and energy
is reduced. The blood is redistributed but most of the blood goes to the brain and heart which
can least withstand anoxia. Skin muscles and digestive organs and other internal organs receive
very little blood while an animal is submerged because these areas can survive with less oxygen.
Muscles shift from aerobic to anaerobic respiration.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter our main focus would be to study diferent processes involved in the transport of
nutrients into the cells and removal of the wastes out of the cells. We would also study, essentially
in plants and animals, the elaborate mechanism involved not only for the movement of individual
molecules but also their mass transport within bodies. The processes involved for getting materials
into and out of the cells are difusion, facilitated difusion, osmosis, active transport, endocytosis,
exocytosis etc.
In animals, the materials move into, within and out of the body, in respiratory circulatory, digestive
and excretory systems. In plants the processes of respiration, transportation, photosynthesis,
absorption by roots, conduction of water, and the nutrients are involved in movement of the
materials into, within and out of the body.
NEED FOR TRANSPORT OF MATERIALS
The living organism is a complex of interactions of physical and chemical reactions involving
diferent elements and molecules. All living cells or living organisms, must obtain and transport
certain materials within the body and also transport and remove the wastes out of their bodies or
cells.
If there were no transport systems, most of the cells of the body of a complex multicellular organism,
would not be able to get the required materials and dispose of their wastes. There are no mass
low systems in unicellular organisms and lower multicellular organisms.
TRANSPORT IN PLANTS
Uptake and Transport of Minerals and Water
The roots of a plant not only anchor the plant body in the soil,
but also absorb minerals and water from the soil. There are
three types of nutrients needed by the plants, carbon dioxide,
water and

kilometers.

minerals besides light to carry out photosynthesis. To get these materials, roots must provide large
surface area for absorption, which is achieved by extensive branching. The roots bear a dense
cluster of tiny hair like structures which are extensions of epidermal cells of roots.
These are the root hairs, which are in fact the sites where most
of the uptake of water and minerals takes place.
Plants are able to sythesize all their required compounds,
with the help of the minerals and H2
0 from soil, C02
 from air,
and light energy. Most of the minerals enter the root hairs
or epidermal cells of roots along with water in bulk low, but
some are taken in by difusion, facilitated difusion, or active
transport.
Mineral absorption by roots
The minerals available to plants for absorption are dissolved
in the soil water. Their concentration vary according to the
fertility and the acidity of the soil, besides other factors. When
the soil minerals are not in solution but are bound by ionic
bonds to soil particles, they are not available to plants.
Processes involved in absorption by roots
The uptake of minerals by root cells is a combination of
passive uptake and active uptake, involving the use of energy
in the form of ATP. The passive uptake involves difusion. The
minerals they also move down their concentration gradient
through plasmodesmata (symplast pathway) to cells of cortex,
endodermis, pericycle and then to sap in xylem cells. From
here they are pulled up by transpiration pull to diferent parts
of plant.
The difusion of ions along with water also takes place by
mass low along the apoplast pathway. Ions moving in the apoplast can only reach the endodermis,
where casparian strips prevent further progress (Fig. 14.1). To cross the endodermis, ions must
pass by difusion or active transport into endodermis cells, entering their cytoplasm, and possibly
their vacuoles. The ions then reach the xylem cells. Difusion of ions can also take the vacuolar
pathway where the ions move along their concentration gradient through the cell membranes,
cytoplasm, and tonoplast (the membrane of vacuoles), and reach the dead xylem cells.
It has been estimated that out
of total surface area provided by
roots, 67% is provided by the root
hairs.
Prosopis trees of leguminoseae
family have maximum depth of
their roots, which is 50 metres.
When inorganic or organic fertilizer
is applied to soil, the minerals are
absorbed primarily as inorganic
ions. The rate of absorption of
each mineral by roots is essentially
independent of the rates of
absorption of water and of the
other minerals. Each mineral
moves into roots at a rate
determined by such factors as
its concentration both inside and
outside the root, the ease with
which it can passively penetrate
cell membrane, and extent to
which carrier molecules and active
absorption are involved.
4
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Most of ions are taken up by the roots by the process of active transport. By this method plants
can take a mineral that is in higher concentration inside the root cells than in the soil solution. In
this process molecules and ions move from their low concentration to their higher concentration
(i.e. against the concentration gradient), through cell membrane, by the use of energy in the form
of ATP. Active transport is selective and is dependent on respiration. Some ions move by passive as
well as by active transport.
Fig.14.1 Mineral and water uptake by roots. The Casparian strip separates the extracellular space in the root into two compartments:
an outer compartment that is continuous with the soil water, and an inner compartment that is continuous with the inside of the
conducting cells of the xylem. The black lines show a pathway for both water and mineral; the blue line is an alternative pathway for
water alone.

Some nutrients are carried from the soil to the epidermal cells of roots through their cell membrane
by facilitated difusion. In this type of difusion, carrier molecules within the cell membrane
transport nutrients across the membrane. These carrier molecules are proteins - which are present
within cell membrane of epidermal and other root cells.
Uptake of Water by Roots
Normally, the movement of water molecules from a region of their higher concentration to a region
of their low concentration through a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. If water
moves by osmosis into a cell the process is called endosmosis, and if the water moves out of the
cell it is called exosmosis.
The cell wall of epidermal cells of roots is freely permeable to water and other minerals. The cell
membrane, however, is diferentially or partially permeable to some substances in the solution.
The water which enters the epidermal cells moves along the concentration gradient and passes
through cortex, endodermis, pericycle and ultimately to xylem cells. (Fig. 14.2)
Symbiotic Relationship

nutrients.
One of the important
nutrient N2
 is almost always
in short supply both in rock
particles and in the soil water.
Most plants have evolved
beneicial relationship with
other organisms that help
the plants acquire these
scarce nutrients. Examples
include: Mycorrhize and
nitrogen ixing bacteria in
root nodules of legumes.
Mycorrhizae help in uptake of minerals
The fungal associations with roots of higher plants, help
mineral uptake by the plant.
The fungi facilitate the uptake of phosphorus and trace
metals such as zinc and copper.
A root infected with mycorrhizal fungi can transport
phosphate at a higher rate than that of an uninfected root.
Mycorrhizal fungi get sugar, and shelter from the plant and
in exchange increase the plant’s mineral nutrient uptake
eiciency. Mycorrhizae are present in 90% families of
lowering plants.

Fig. 14.2 Diagrammatic representation of water and ion movement across a root showing transverse section. The apoplast pathway
is of greatest importance for both water and solutes. The symplast pathway is less important, except for salts in the region of the
endodermis. Movement along the vacuolar pathway is negligible.
Following are the paths taken by water to reach the xylem tissue:
(i) The apoplast pathway
It is the pathway involving system of adjacent cell walls which is continuous throughout the plant
roots. In the roots apoplast pathway becomes discontinuous in the endodermis due to the presence
of casparian strips.
(ii) The Symplast pathway
It is the system of interconnected protoplasts in the root cells. The cytoplasm of neighbouring cells
(Protoplasts) is connected with one another by Plasmodesmata which are cytoplasmic strands that
extend through pores in adjacent cell walls. In the cells of root the cell membrane and cytoplasm
(and plasmodesmata) can be regarded as acting together as one partially permeable membrane.
(iii) The vacuolar pathway
In this pathway water moves from vacuole to vacuole through neighbouring cells crossing the
symplast and apoplast in the process and moving through cell membranes by osmosis. Water
moves passively down a concentration gradient.

14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Water Potential (Symbolized By Greek Letter Psi = yw )
Water molecules possess kinetic energy which means that in liquid or gaseous form, they move
about rapidly and randomly from one place to another. So, greater the concentration of the water
molecules in a system the greater is the total kinetic energy of water molecules. This is called water
potential (yw).
In plant cells two factors determine water potential.
i) Solute concentration (Osmotic or solute potential = ys)
ii) Pressure generated when water enters and inlates plant cells (Pressure potential = yp).
Pure water has maximum water potential which by deinition is zero.
Water moves from a region of higher yw to lower yw .
All solutions have lower yw than pure water and so have negative value of yw (at atmospheric
pressure and at a deined temperature). So osmosis can be deined as:
“The movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower
water potential through a partially permeable membrane”.
Osmotic (Solute) Potential = ys
The osmotic (solute) potential ys is a measure of the change in water potential(ys) of a system
due to the presence of solute molecules. ys is always negative. More solute molecules present,
lower (more negative) is the ys.
Pressure Potential (yp)
If pressure greater than atmospheric pressure is applied to pure water or a solution, its water
potential increases. It is equivalent to pumping water from one place to another. Such a situation
may arise in living systems.
When water enters plant cells by osmosis pressure may be built up inside the cell making the cell
turgid and increasing the pressure potential. Thus the total water potential is sum of ys and yp.
 yw = ys + yp
 water potential solute potential pressure potential
8
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
If we use the term water potential, the tendency for water to move between any two systems can
be measured; not just from cell to cell in a plant but also from soil to root from leaf to air or from
soil to air. The steeper the potential gradient the faster is the low of water along it.
The following example would help understand the concept of water potential. Two adjacent
vacuolated cells are shown with yw, yp and ys.

Q. a) Which cell has the higher water potential?
 b) In which direction will water move by osmosis?
 c) What will be the water potential of the cells at equilibrium?
 d) What will be the solute potential and pressure potential of the cells at
 equilibrium?
Plasmolysis and Pressure Potential
Plasmolysis can be deined as the shrinkage of protoplast due to exosmosis of water. When a living
cell is placed in a solution having lower water potential than that of the cell, plasmolysis takes place
and the cell is called plasmolysed. If this plasmolysed cell is placed in distilled water (which has
highest water potential) the water molecules would move from distilled water through diferentially
permeable cell membrane into the cell, and the cell would become deplasmolysed.

which is the pressure
exerted by a vertical
force of one Newton
on an area of 1 metre
square.
9
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The point at which plasmolysis is just about to happen is called incipient plasmolysis. At incipient
plasmolysis the protoplast has just ceased to exert any pressure against the cell wall, so the cell is
laccid.
If a plasmolysed cell is placed in distilled water, the one having higher water potential than the
contents of the cell, water enters the cell by endosmosis, volume of protoplast increases, and it
begins to exert pressure against the cell wall of plant cell. The cell wall is rigid - so the pressure exerted
by the protoplast against the cell wall is called pressure potential. As the pressure potential of the
cell increases due to endosmosis, the cell becomes turgid. Full turgidity i.e. maximum pressure
potential is achieved when a cell is placed in pure water or distilled water.
The animal cells cannot withstand higher pressure potential as there is no cell wall around protoplast.
Thus the turgid cells burst in a solution of higher water potential. So the animals employ the
mechanism of osmoregulation to maintain the amount of water and salts in their cells to constant
or nearly constant levels.
ASCENT OF SAP
In the previous pages you have learned that water and dissolved minerals traverse the cortex
and endodermis and reach the xylem tissue of roots. (Fig. 14.1,14.2) Actually, water and dissolved
minerals are carried or pulled upwards towards the leaves through xylem tissue. This is called
ascent of sap. This may involve the following :
(A) Cohesion Tension Theory (B) Root Pressure (C) Imbibition
(A) Cohesion tension theory is one of the most important theories proposed by Dixon. This
theory provides a reasonable explanation of low of water and minerals upwards from the roots
to leaves of plants, in bulk low or mass low (Fig. 14.5). This depends on the following:
(i) Cohesion: It is the attraction among water molecules which hold water together, forming a solid
chain-like column within the xylem tubes. The water molecules form hydrogen bonds between
them.
(ii) Tension: It is provided when this water chain is pulled up in the xylem (Fig. 14.4). Transpiration
10
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
provides the necessary energy or force. Tension is between the molecules of water by hydrogen
bonds.
This xylem water tension is strong enough to pull water up to 200 metres (more than 600 feet) in
plants.
(iii) Adhesion: It may be added that the water molecules also adhere to the cell walls of xylem cells,
so that the column of water in xylem tissue does not break. The composition of cell wall provides
necessary adhesion to water molecules that helps water creep up. The cellulose component of cell
wall especially has great ainity for water. It can imbibe water.
Fig.14.4 (a) Xylem Tissue elements involved in transportation of water and dissolved minerals, (b) Scanning electron micrograph of
two large vessel elements of a cucumber root.
(iv) Strong xylem walls: It is essential that the xylem walls should have high tensile strength if they
are not to buckle inwards. The lignin and cellulose provides strength to cell wall of xylem vessels
(Fig. 14.4).
11
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
By cohesion-tension of water molecules, and the transpiration pull providing the necessary energy,
the sap (water and minerals) in xylem tissue is pulled upwards to the leaves. Large quantities of
water are carried at relatively high speed, upto 8mh-1 being recorded in tall trees, and commonly
in other plants at 1mh-1
.
The total water pulled up in the leaves is transpired, except about 1% which is used by plant in
various activities including photosynthesis.
Mechanism of transpiration pull in cohesion tension theory
The evaporation of water from the aerial parts of the plant especially through stomata of leaves
is a process called transpiration. As a leaf transpires the water potential of its mesophyll cells
drops. This drop, causes water to move by osmosis from the xylem cells of leaf into dehydrating
mesophyll cells. The water molecules leaving the xylem are attached to other water molecules
in the same xylem tube by hydrogen bonds (cohesion of water molecules). Therefore, when one
water molecule moves up the xylem, the process continues all the way to the root - where water
is pulled from the xylem cells (tracheids and vessels). This pull also causes water to move down its
concentration gradient transversely from the root epidermis (root hairs) to cortex by endosmosis
and to pericycle. This pulling force or transpiration pull is so strong that it also reduces the water
potential of root epidermal cells. Then water in the soil moves from its higher water potential to
lower water potential of epidermis of root by osmosis.

(B) Root pressure : Second force involved in the movement of water and dissolved minerals up
in the xylem tissue is the root pressure. Root pressure is created by the active secretion of salts and
other solutes from the other cells into the xylem sap. This lowers the water potential of xylem sap.
Water enters the xylem cells by osmosis, thus increasing the level of sap in the xylem cells. Water
entering the xylem cells, may take apoplast, symplast or vacuolar pathway increasing the hydrostatic
pressure in cells, this pushes the water upwards. As a result of root pressure the sap in the xylem
does not rise to enough height in most plants. The root pressure is also least efective during the
day, when transpiration pull is the active force involved in pulling the sap in xylem cells upwards.
It has been estimated that a positive hydrostatic pressure of around 100 to 200 KPa (exceptionally
800 KPa) is generated by root pressure. The pressure mentioned above is not enough to push
water upwards to required height in most plants. But it is no doubt a contributing factor in plants
which transpire slowly, and are smaller in size.
Closely associated with root pressure
is a phenomenon called guttation or
exudation. Guttation is loss of liquid
water through water secreting glands
or hydathodes. The dew drops that can
be seen on the tips of grass leaves or
strawberry leaves are actually guttation
droplets exuded from hydathodes. (Fig.
14.6).
Guttation or exudation is more notable
when transpiration is suppressed, and
the relative humidity is high as at night.
The guttation is in fact due to positive
pressure - the root pressure, developed
in xylem tissue of roots.
(C) Imbibition : Another important force in the ascent of sap is imbibition. Sacks in 1874 sugested
that the water molecules move along the cell walls of xylem vessels due to imbibition.
The cell wall components especially cellulose, pectin and lignin can take up water and as a result

14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
increase in volume, but the components do not dissolve in water, this is called imbibition. The
amount of attraction and increase of dry cell walls of plant cells, and of protoplasm for water is
often very great and considerable imbibition forces may be developed in plant body. The root cell
walls imbibe water from the soil, and this water moves by apoplast pathway already discussed.
Imbibition is a reversible process and when water is lost the original volume of cell wall and of
protoplasm is restored. The uptake of water by imbibition is especially important in germinating
seeds. The volume of dry seed may increase up to 200 times by imbibition, as a result, the seed
coat ruptures and makes the germination of seed efective.
Bleeding : Sometimes it so happens that certain plants, when cut, pruned, tapped or otherwise
wounded, show a low of sap from the cut ends or surfaces quite often with a considerable force.
This phenomenon is commonly called bleeding.
It is often seen in many land plants in the spring, particularly grape wine, some palms, sugar maple
etc.
Although the low of sap is ordinarily slow, a considerable quantity of the sap within a period of 24
hours comes out of the plant. In some palms when tapped, there may be a low of sap to the extent
of 10-15 litres per day. The sap in such plants contains sugars and water in addition to organic and
inorganic substances (e.g. salts).
There are two main factors responsible for bleeding, the hydrostatic pressure in xylem and phloem
elements, and the root pressure, which is exerted by the xylem tissues of roots.
TYPES OF TRANSPIRATION
You have already studied the role of transpiration, in ascent of sap.
There are three types of transpiration depending upon the route of escape of water vapours from
the aerial parts of the plant.
(i) Cuticular transpiration (ii) Lenticular transpiration (iii) Stomatal transpiration
15
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
(i) Cuticular transpiration : The loss of water in the form of water vapours through the cuticle
of leaves is called cuticular transpiration. About 5-7% of total transpiration takes place through this
route.
The cuticle present on the upper and lower epidermis of leaves is not completely impermeable
to water and some water is lost in the form of vapours through cuticle. The thinner the cuticle
the greater is the rate of transpiration; although the composition of cuticle is also important. At
night, when the stomata are almost closed, cuticular transpiration takes place. Most of the factors
which afect rate of transpiration, in general, are also important in controlling the rate of cuticular
transpiration.
(ii) Lenticular transpiration : Lenticular transpiration is the loss of water vapours through
lenticels present in the stem of some plants. (Fig. 14.7) All plants do not possess lenticels.
Animation 14.4: Transpiration

16
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The lenticular transpiration is 1-2% of the total transpiration by a plant. These openings, like
stomata,are also involved in the exchange of gases between environment. When there is strong
light and high temperature,the loss of vapours is rapid because it is governed by difusion.
Lenticels are aerating pores formed in the bark through which exchange of gases takes place, and
water is lost in the form of water vapours (transpiration). Externally, they appear as scars or small
protrusions on the surface of stem. Lenticel consists of a loose mass of small, thin-walled cells.
At each lenticel the cork cambium forms oval, spherical, or irregular cells, which are very loosely
arranged, having lots of intercellular spaces.
Fig. 14.7 Left : The waterproof outer bark (layer of dark cells on the surface) on this section of stem is interrupted at the center of
the lenticel. Thus the more loosely arranged cell layer beneath, with their numerous intercellular air spaces, are exposed to the
atmosphere, Right: The individual lenticels can be seen as white areas on the surface of a young stem.
(iii) Stomatal transpiration : It is a type of transpiration in which the water vapours escape
through stomata. In isobilateral leaves the stomata are present, in both, upper and lower epidermis
e.g. lily and maize leaf. In dorsiventral leaves the stomata are conined to only the lower epidermis.
The guard cells are normally dumble or bean-seed-shaped. The inner concave sides of two guard
cells enclose the stoma. This inner side of guard cell has very thick cell wall, but the outer convex
17
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
side has thin cell wall. The guard cells are the only cells, of leaf epidermis, which are not connected
by plasmodesmata to other epidermal cells, and which have chloroplasts - and thus are involved
in the process of photosynthesis (Fig. 14.8). When these guard cells are turgid, the stoma between
them opens and when the guard cells are laccid the stoma between them closes. The degree of
opening of stomatal pores also afects the rate of transpiration. 90% of total transpiration in a plant
is stomatal.
The cells of mesophyll of leaf provide enormous surface ‘area for the loss of water in the form of
vapours. The pathway of water vapours loss to the atmosphere, through stomata is shown. (Fig.
14.8)
Fig.14.8 The water pathway through the leaf. Water is drawn from the xylem into the cell walls of the mesophyll, where it evaporates
into the air spaces within the leaf. By difusion, water vapour then moves through the leaf air space, through the stomatal pore, and
across the boundary layer of still air that adheres to the outer leaf surface. C02
 also difuses into the leaf through stomata along a
concentration gradient.
OPENING AND CLOSING OF STOMATA
The guard cells function as multisensory hydraulic valves (Fig. 14.9). Environmental factors, such as
light intensity and quality, temperature, relative humidity, and intracellular CO2
 concentration are
18
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
sensed by guard cells and these signals are integrated into well-deined stomatal responses.
There are two hypotheses which may explain the opening and closing of stomata.
i) Starch Sugar Hypothesis : The German botanist H. Van Mohl proposed that the guard cells
are the only photosynthesising cells of epidermis of leaf and sugars are produced in them during
day time when light is available. When sugar level rises i.e. solute concentration increases or water
potential decreases - and the guard cells become turgid due to entry of water and they separate
from one another, and stoma or pore opnes. During night there is no photosynthesis the sugars
are either converted into insoluble starch or are used in respiration, this decreases free sugars
in cell. So the osmotic pressure of guard cells is lowered, and water leaves the guard cells, which
become laccid and stoma or pore between them closes. But these processes are not fast enough
to account for the rapid rise in turgor, of guard cells.
ii) Inlux of K+
 ions : Potassium concentration in guard cells increases several fold, depending
upon plant species.
Stomata open due to active transport of potassium ions (K+
) into the guard cells from the surrounding
epidermis. The accumulation of K+
 decreases the osmotic potential of guard cells. Water enters
the guard cells by osmosis, which become more turgid and stretched and stomata are opened.
The stoma closes by reverse process; involving passive difusion of K+
 from guard cells followed
by water moving out by osmosis. What controls the movement of K+
 into and out of guard cells?
Level of carbon dioxide in the spaces inside the leaf and light, control this movement. A low level
of carbon dioxide favours opening of the stomata, thus allowing an increased carbon dioxide level
and increased rate of photosynthesis.
Exposure to blue light, which is also efective in photosynthesis has been shown to acidify the
environment of the guard cells (i.e. pumps out protons) which enable the guard cells to take up K+
followed by water uptake resulting in increased turgidity of guard cells. So in general stoma are
open during day and closed at night. This prevents needless loss of water by the plant when it is
too dark for photosynthesis.
The plants open their stomata by actively pumping Potassium in guard cells causing water to follow
by osmosis. Guard cells become turgid and stoma or pore opens. When Potassium leaves the
guard cells (during night) water leaves the guard cells by exosmosis and guard cells become laccid
and stoma or pore between guard cells closes.

that the guard cells contain chloroplasts (the green ovals within the cells) but that the other epidermal cells do not.
Factors affecting the rate of transpiration
Rate of transpiration for a plant is very important as the transpiration stream is necessary to
Animation 14.5: Stomata

20
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
distribute dissolved mineral salts throughout the plant. Water is transported to photosynthesizing
cells of leaves. Transpiration is also very important as it cools the plant. This is especially important
in higher temperatures. If the rate of transpiration is very high, there would be much loss of water
from the plant, so at high temperatures the stomata almost close and reduction in the rate of
transpiration is efected. This stops wilting of the leaves and of plants (herbaceous plants).
There are some important factors which afect the rate of transpiration in a plant.
(i) Light (ii) Temperature
(iii) CO2 concentration (iv) Humidity and vapour pressure
(v) Wind and (vi) Availability of soil water.
i) Light : The opening and closing of stomata is directly controlled by the light. In strong light the
rate of transpiration is much more as compared with that in dim light or no light. As Potassium
actively enters the guard cells, when light is available, water follows - and guard cells become turgid,
and stoma opens.
ii) Temperature: When the sun-light is strong on a bright and sunny day the environmental
temperature is increased. The higher temperature reduces the humidity of the surrounding air.
The evaporation of water from the surfaces of mesophyll cells also increases, thus increasing the
rate of transpiration.
The rate of transpiration doubles by every rise of 10°C in temperature. Very high environmental
temperature, i.e. 40-45°C cause closure of stomata, so that plant does not loose much needed water.
If higher temperatures are maintained in the environment
for a longer duration and soil water is limited, the plants
would wilt and may die.
iii) Carbon dioxide concentration : Low carbon
dioxide concentration (such as those that occurs during the
day when photosynthesis exceeds respiration), stimulates
the active transport of Potassium ions into the guard cells. This transport (as discussed earlier)
causes stomata to open and allow C02
 to difuse in the mesophyll cells of leaves. At night cellular
respiration in the absence of photosynthesis raises C02
 levels. This halts the inward transport of K+
,
and thus of water, allowing the guard cells to become laccid and stomata close. Thus transpiration
almost stops.
Hormones are involved in stomatal movement in
plants. At high temperature when leaf cells start
wilting a hormone is released by mesophyll cells.
This hormone is called abscisic acid. This hormone
stops the active transport of K+
 into guard cells,
overriding the efect of light and C02 concentration.
So K+
 pumping stops. Stomata close.
21
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
iv) Humidity and vapour pressure : When air is dry, the rate of difusion of water molecules,
from the surfaces of mesophyll cells, air spaces, and through stomata to outside the leaf, increases
(Fig. 14.8). So more water is lost, increasing the rate of transpiration. In humid air the difusion rate
is reduced. This decreases the rate of transpiration appreciably.
v) Wind : The air in motion is called wind, which causes increase in rate of difusion of water
molecules. The rate of evaporation from the surfaces of mesophyll cells increases. When air is still,
the rate of movement of water molecules (difusion) is slowed down, thus reducing the rate of
transpiration.
vi) Availability of soil water : If there is little water in the soil, less is brought or transported
to the leaf cells and less is lost to the environment by transpiration. So when the rate of absorption
of water in root cells is reduced, the rate of transpiration is reduced.
Transpiration as a necessary evil
Transpiration has been described as necessary evil because it is an inevitable, but potentially
harmful consequence of the existence of wet cell surfaces from which evaporation occurs. Loss of
water from the plant can lead to wilting, serious desiccation and often death of a plant if conditions
of drought are experienced. There is good evidence that even mild water stress results in reduced
growth rate and in crops to economic losses through reduction of yield.
Despite its apparent inevitability it is also of very great importance for the plant.
i) Water is conducted or transported in most tall plants with the courtesy of transportation pull.
ii) Minerals dissolved in water are distributed throughout plant body by transpiration stream.
iii) Evaporation of water from the exposed surface of cells of leaves has cooling efect on plant.
iv) Wet surface of leaf cells allow gaseous exchange.
TRANSLOCATION OF ORGANIC SOLUTES
Organic solutes are transported by phloem tissue.
Phloem Transport
The phloem is generally found on the outer side of both primary and secondary vascular tissue in
plants with secondary growth. The phloem constitute the inner bark. The cells of phloem thatconduct
22
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
or transport sugars and other organic material throughout the plant are called sieve elements.
In addition to sieve elements, phloem tissue also contains companion cells, parenchyma cells, and
in some cases ibres, sclereids and latex containing cells. However, only sieve tube cells are directly
involved in transport of organic solutes.
Sieve elements are characterised by ‘sieve areas’ portions of the cell wall where pores interconnect
the conducting cells. Some of the sieve areas of sieve tube members are generally formed in end
walls of sieve tube members where the individual cells are joined together to form a longitudinal
series called a sieve tube. Sieve plate pores of sieve tubes are essentially open channels, that allow
transport between cells (Fig. 14.10).
Fig. 14.10 (a) This diagram shows part of the root phloem consisting of sieve tube members stacked end to end. Adjoining end walls
have common pores. Each sieve tube member is associated with a companion cell (b) Sieve tube member showing the pores in its end
walls. Note the scarcity of cytoplasmic components in these sugar conducting cells.
Each sieve tube member is associated with one or more companion cells. Sieve tubes and companion
cells are in communication with each other by plasmodesmata. Companion cells supply ATP and
proteins to sieve tubes. The photosynthetic products from photosynthesizing cells, the mesophyll
and palisade layer of leaf, pass into sieve tubes, through the companion cell via plasmodesmata.
Patterns of Transport
Phloem transport does not occur exclusively in an upward or a downward direction and is not
deined with respect of gravity. Transport or translocation occurs from the areas of supply (sources)
to areas of metabolism or storage (sinks).
23
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
The areas of sources include any exporting organ typically a mature leaf, or storage organ, that is
capable of
i) Storing photosynthate in excess of its own needs.
ii) Storage organ during the exporting phase of its development. In biennials e.g root of beet is a
sink in irst growing season, but becomes source in the
next growing season, when sugars are utilized in growth
of new shoots.
iii) Sinks are the areas of active metabolism or storage
for example roots, tubers, developing fruits, immature
leaves, and even the growing tips of stem and root.
The movement in phloem is from source to sinks in most
of the plants during active photosynthesis.
The composition of materials lowing in phloem has
been studied by using aphids - the insects which are
phloem feeders (Fig 14.11). These insects insert their
stylets into stem or leaf and extend them to puncture
a sieve tube. The pressure in the sieve tube cell forces
sap through aphid’s digestive tract and out its posterior
end as droplets called “honey dew”. The composition of
honey dew have revealed that it contains 10-25% dry
matter 90% or more of which is sucrose. Nitrogenous
compounds are about 1%.

The Mechanism of phloem translocation/transport
The theory called, Pressure - Flow Theory, is the most acceptable theory for the transport in the
phloem of angiosperms. We have considerable evidence to support this theory. There were two
main categories of theories to account for movement of sap in phloem. The active theories involving
the use of energy for the movement of materials in phloem, and the passive theories in which no
use of energy was involved. The active theories have all been abandoned as there is not much
evidence to support these theories.
Now we are left with passive theories of transport / translocation. These include:
25
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
(i) Difusion (ii) Pressure low theory
(i) Difusion: is far too slow, to account for the velocities of sugar movement in phloem, which
on the average is 1 metre per hour, while the rate of difusion is 1 metre per eight years. So we are
left with pressure low theory.
 Fig.14.12 Movement of sugars from mesophyll cells to sieve elements.
(ii) Pressure low theaory: A hypothesis was irst proposed by Ernst Munch in 1930. It states
that the low of solution in the sieve elements is driven by anosmotically generated pressure
gradient between””source and sink. Now this hypothesis has been given status of a theory. See Fig.
14.13, the following steps,explain pressure low theory.
(1) The glucose formed in the photosynthesizing cells, is used within the cells (for respiration
etc.) and the rest is converted into non-reducing sugar i.e. sucrose. (2) This sucrose is actively
transported through the bundle sheath cells to the companion cell of the smallest vein in leaf, a
26
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
short distance transport (involving 2 - 3 cells). Thus sucrose difuses through plasmodesmata to
sieve tube cell or sieve element, raising the concentration of sucrose in it. (Fig. 14.12) The pathway
taken by sucrose is symplast in most cases; but is some, apoplastic movement does take place.
The sucrose is actively transported to the sieve elements. (3) The water moves by osmosis from the
nearby xylem in the leaf vein. This increases the hydrostatic pressure of the sieve tube element.
(4) Hydrostatic pressure moves the sucrose and other substances in the sieve tube cells, and moves
to sinks e.g. fruits and roots. In the storage sinks, such as sugar beet root and sugarcane stem,
sucrose is removed into apoplast prior to entering symplast of the sink.
(5) Water moves out of sieve tube cell by osmosis, lowering the hydrostatic pressure.
In symplastic pathway, sucrose (or sugars) move through plasmodesmata to the receiver cell. Thus
according to pressure low theory, the pressure gradient is established as a consequence of entry
of sugars in the sieve elements at the source; and removal of sugars (sucrose) at the sink (Fig.
14.13). The energy driven entry of sugars in sieve tube elements, generate high osmotic pressure
in the sieve tube elements of the source causing a steep drop in the water potential.
(6) The presence of sieve plates greatly increases the resistance along the pathway and results in
the generation and maintenance of a substantial pressure gradient in the sieve elements between
source and sink.
The sieve element’s contents are physically pushed along the transportation pathway by bulk low,
much like water lowing through a garden hose.
The pressure low theory accounts for the mass low of molecules within phloem. It may be noted
that the transpertation of photosynthate or carbohydrates from the mesophyll cells to phloem
tissue involves difusion and active transport (carrier mediated transport). Then in phloem tissue
(sieve tubes) the movement of materials is according to pressure low theory.
Again in the sink cells when the sugar and the carbohydrates are passed from the phloem tissue,
difusion and carrier mediated transport, either passive or active, takes place, (see table 14.1).

of sucrose. (3) Water (blue dots leaves nearby xylem and moves into the “leaf end” of the sieve tube by osmosis (blue arrow), raising
the hydrostatic pressure. (4) The same sieve tube connects to a developing fruit (sink); sucrose enters the companion cells by difusion
through plasmodesmata. It is then actively transported out of the companion cells and into the fruit cells. (5) Water moves out of
the sieve tube by osmosis, lowering the hydrostatic pressure within the tube. (6) High pressure in the leaf end of the phloem and low
pressure in the fruit end cause water, together with any dissolved solutes, to low in bulk from leaf (source) to fruit. (Black arrow).

TRANSPORT IN ANIMALS
Unicellular animals have maximum surface area to volume ratio; and most of the substances move
into or out of their bodies by simple difusion, osmosis, active transport, and facilitated difusion.
So there are no special transport systems involved. Same is true of simple multicellular animals
which are aquatic. But complex multicellular animals possess highly organized, and well developed
transport system, in the form of blood vascular system.
Transportation in Hydra
It is fresh water in habitat. The body is two layered;
the outer ectoderm and inner endoderm; in between
them is mesogloea which is non-cellular. The outer
surfaces of the ectoderm cells are exposed to the
water in which the animal lives. Water, dissolved 02
,
and food is taken into the coelenteron(enteron) of
Hydra by the movement of tentacles, and lagella
which are present in most cells of endoderm.
The materials and food may be absorbed or taken
up by endocytosis into endodermal cells. The
indigestible and partly digested food is removed
by exocytosis from these cells, into digestive cavity
(coelenteron). Ectodermal cells get food from
endodermal cells by difusion.
The ectodermal cells directly exchange materials
with the surrounding water (Fig 14.14). They also
get nutrients from endodermal cells.
Fig.14.14 Hydra
29
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1

Transportation in Planaria
The body of Planaria is lat, so the most of its cells are exposed to the outer water. Difusion is the
process involved in the movement of materials into and out of the cells.
There is no special transport system in Planaria. The reasons are:
(i) The body of Planaria is lat, and provides greater surface area for the exchange of materials,
 between the body and the environment.
(ii) Planaria is acoelomate i.e. there is no body cavity and the mesodermal layer or mesenchyme is
 composed of loosely packed cells between ectoderm and endoderm. Whatever materials, such
 as 02
, difuse in the ectoderm, pass to mesoderm cells and then difuse into endoderm cells.
 For the removal of wastes the same route is reversed. Intestinal caecae reach near almost every
 cell of the body and digested food is provided to the cells by difusion. The endoderm cells, can
 also acquire food, water, dissolved minerals, and to some extent 02
. and remove wastes into the
 gut.
CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
In the body of larger and complex animals, there is very little exposed surface area to volume ratio.
Most of the cells are not exposed to the external environment directly and it becomes very diicult
to transport materials by simpl difusion. Complex animals have evolved transport systems in the
form of blood vascular system or circulatory system.
Characteristics of Circulatory System
A circulatory system accounts for rapid mass low of materials from one part of the body to the
other, where difusion would be too slow.
There are three characteristics of a circulatory system.
(A) A circulatory luid - the blood.
(B) A contractile pumping device - which may be the modiied blood vessel or a heart.
(C) Tubes, which can transport the circulatory luid (blood) to and from cells of the body These
 tubes are the blood vessels. Materials must be exchanged between the circulatory luid and
 other body cells.

Open and Closed Circulatory System
The circulatory systems of animals are divided into two main types:
a) Open circulatory system: It is observed in animals belonging to Phylum Arthropoda (crustaceans,
spiders, insects) and Phylum Mollusca (snails and clams) and group of protochordates, the tunicates.
b) closed circulatory system: It is observed in animals belonging to annelids,cephalopod molluscs
(squids and octopus), echinoderms and vertebrates.
The diferences between open circulatory system and closed circulatory system would be clear by
studying the comparison between circulartary systems of earth worm and cockroach, (see table

Vertebrate blood circulatory system
The components of vertebrate blood vascular system are typical of a circulatory system-blood,
heart, blood vessels (arteries, capillaries and veins). All vertebrates have closed circulatory system
In addition there is lymphatic system which also aids in transportation.
Heart pumps the blood to diferent parts of the body via aorta and arteries Arteries break into ine
blood vessels, the capillaries. These join to form veins which bring blood back to the heart. The
capillaries are sites where exchange of materials between blood and body tissues takes place.
Evolution of vertebrate heart
The heart of ishes have sinus venosus, an atrium, a ventricle, and bulbus arteriosus or conus
arteriosus. Sinus venosus receives deoxygenated blood from the body,and then blood is passed
to atrium, which on contraction passes it to ventricle. ventricle has thick muscular wall. When
the muscles of ventricle contract, they push the blood via conus arteriosus or bulbous arteriosus
(proximal swollen portion of ventral aorta).

Thus the heart of fishes works as a single circuit heart. The blood flows in one direction only,
from sinus venosus to atrium then to ventricle
and to ventral aorta via bulbus arteriosus or conus
arteriosus to the gills and then to the body. The
blood returns to the heart in the sinus venosus The
oxygenated blood is supplied from dorsal aorta
through coronary arteries,to the heart and is carried
back by coronary veins from the heart).
In amphibians the heart is three chambered with regard to auricles and ventricles.There are two
auricles and one ventricle. In addition, sinus venosus and truncus arteriosus are also present.
Sinus venosus receives de-oxygenated blood from two superior venacavae (precavals) and one
inferior vena cava (postcaval) from diferent parts
of the body. This blood passes to the right auricle.
The oxygenated blood from lungs is poured via
pulmonary veins into left auricle. Both auricles
contract simultaneously and blood is passed
into the ventricle. There is a complete mixing
of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the
ventricle. When ventricle contracts, it pushes
blood via truncus arteriosus, to two carotids, two
systemics, and two pulmocutaneous arches.
(Fig. 14.19b).
The heart of the ishes never receives oxygenated blood.
It is only the deoxygenated blood which passes through
diferent chambers of the heart. (Fig. 14.18 a). The valves
present in the heart control the low of blood in single
direction i.e. sinus venosus —> atrium —> ventricle conus
arteriosus —> ventral aorta —> gills —> dorsal aorta —»
body —» sinus venosus. So the heart of ishes functions as
a single circuit heart.

Fig.14.18 A schematic comparison of vertebrate heart and circulation of blood. (A) In modern ish
the blood is pumped to the gills, where it picks up oxygen. The oxygenated blood (red) then passes
without further pumping to the systemic circulation, where it gives up its oxygen before returning
to the heart. (B) In amphibians the blood that has picked up oxygen in the gills and/or lungs returns
to the heart, from which it is pumped into the systemic circulation. Extensive mixing (purple) of
the pulmonary and systemic lows occurs in the heart. (C) In reptiles the pattern is much the same,
except that the ventricles are partially divided, so less mixing takes place. (D) In mammals and birds
the two halves of the heart are efectively separated.
The heart of reptiles and all other amniotes practically functions as four chambered heart. There
are two auricles in the heart of reptiles. The reptiles have incompletely partitioned ventricle; but in
crocodiles, the interventricular septum is complete and heart is four chambered. In all reptiles the
left and right systemic arches carry oxygenated blood and arise from a region of ventricle called
36
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
cavum venosum - into which left ventricle directs its blood. The deoxygenated blood from the right
atrium is directed towards the entrance of the pulmonary trunk which is also located or starts from
a pocket the cavum pulmonale, on right side of ventricle- in the animals (reptiles) which do not have
completely divided ventricle. Although the two systemic arches start from the ventricle separately,
they are also interconnected at their base by an opening. The heart of reptiles birds and mammals
functions as double circuit heart. (Fig. 14.19c).
In the birds and mammals, the heart is four -
chambered, and oxygenated and deoxygenated
blood does not mix at all. The pulmonary trunk
arises from right ventricle and leads to the lungs.
The aortic trunk emerges from the left ventricle
and leads to carotid and systemic arches. The left
systemic disappears in birds and right systemic,
most of it, disappears in mammals. (Fig. 14.19
D).
In reptile, birds and mammals, as a result of
these modiications, all blood returning to the
right side of the heart passes to the lungs. After
oxygenation, blood returns to left atrium from
the lungs via pulmonary veins. Left atrium passes
this blood to left ventricle - which on contraction
pumps it to diferent parts of the body, and
again blood returns to right atrium (Fig.14.18D).
Pulmonary circulation is by pulmonary arch
carrying deoxygenated blood from right ventricle
of heart to lungs, and the blood returns to left
atrium after oxygenation via pulmonary veins.
Likewise the systemic arch distributes blood
to diferent parts of the body, and then the
blood from the body returns to the heart, in
the right atrium via precaval and postcaval.
This is systemic circulation. So the hearts of
amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals have
both pulmonary and systemic circulation. Fig. 14.19 The human circulatory system
37
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
TRANSPORT IN MAN :
In humans, in addition to blood circulatory system, there is also another transport system, the
lymphatic system, described latter in this chapter.
Blood circulatory system
The circulatory system of humans have the same 3 basic components.
(A) Circulating luid - the blood.
(B) The pumping organ - the heart.
(C) The blood vessels, arteries, capillaries and veins.
(A) The circulatory luid-the blood
The blood is the medium in which dissolved nutrients, gases, hormones, and wastes are transported
through the body. It is made up of two main components, (i) plasma and (ii) cells or cell - like bodies
(white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets). The weight of the blood in our body is about 1/12th of
our body.
(i) PLASMA : It has been estimated that in a normal person plasma constitutes about 55% by
volume of the blood, and cells or cell-like bodies about 45% by volume of the blood.
Plasma is primarily water in which proteins, salts, nutrients and wastes are dissolved. Water
constitutes about 90% of plasma, 10% are dissolved substances. Most of the dissolved substances
are maintained at a constant or nearly constant level, but others occur in varying concentrations.
The substances dissolved or present in plasma vary in their concentrations, with the condition of
the organism and with the portion of the system under examination. The solutes can be divided
into six categories:
Inorganic salts (ions) - Plasma proteins - Organic nutrients - Nitrogenous waste products - Special
products being transported and gases which are dissolved.
1. Inorganic ions or mineral ions. Together the inorganic ions and salts make up 0.9 per cent
of the plasma, of humans, by weight; more than two thirds of this amount is sodium chloride the
ordinary table salt. Even if the total concentration of dissolved substances remains the same, shifts
38
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
in the concentration of particular ion can create serious disturbances. The normal pH of human
blood is 7.4; and it is maintained between narrow limits, because the change in pH would afect the
chemical reactions of the body.
2. The plasma proteins constitute 7-9 percent by weight of the plasma. Most of these proteins
are synthesized in the liver. Some of the globulins, called immunoglobulins or antibodies, are
produced in response to antigens, by lymphocytes; and then are passed to plasma, and lymph.
The proteins like prothrombin acts as a catalyst in blood clotting process. Fibrinogen takes part in
the blood clotting process. Immunoglobulins play important role in body’s defenses against disease.
3. Organic nutrients in the blood include, glucose, fats, phospholipids, amino acids and
lactic acids. Some of them enter the blood from the intestine (absorption). Lactic acid is produced
in muscles as a result of glycolysis, and is transported by blood to liver. Cholesterol is an important
constituent, it is metabolized to some extent, but also serves as precursor of steroid hormones.
4. Plasma also contains nitrogenous waste products formed as a result of cellular
metabolism. These products are carried from the liver where they are produced, to the organs from
where they are removed i.e. kidneys. Urea and small amounts of uric acid are present in plasma.
5. All the hormones in the body are carried by blood - so they are present in the plasma.
6. The gases such as CO2
, O2
 are present in the plasma of the blood.

 Fig.14.20 Red blood cells (erythrocytes) and white blood cells (leucocytes) develop from stem cells in bone marrow.
(ii) BLOOD CELLS AND CELL LIKE BODIES : These include red blood cells, (Erythrocytes),
white blood cells (leucocytes) and platelets.
(a) Red blood cells (Erythrocytes) : These are most numerous of the cells in the blood. A
cubic millimeter contains 5-1/2 million of them in males, and 4-1/2 million in females. These cells,
when formed, have nucleus, but it is lost before they enter the circulatory luid or blood. 95% of the
cytoplasm of red blood cells is the red pigment, called haemoglobin the remaining 5% consists of
enzymes, salts and other proteins. The red cells once mature, do not divide.
Red blood cells are formed principally in the red bone marrow of short bones, such as the sternum,
ribs and vertebrae (Fig. 14.20). In the embryonic life, they are formed in the liver and spleen. The
average life span of red blood cell is about four months after which it breaks down and disintegrates
in the liver and spleen - partly by phagocytes by phagocytosis (Table -14.2)
(b) White blood cells (Leucocytes): These blood cells are colourless, as they do not contain
40
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
pigments. One cubic millimetre of blood contains 7000 to 8000 of them. They are much larger than
the red blood cells. There are at least ive diferent types which can be distinguished on the basis
of the shape of the nucleus and density of granules in the cytoplasm (Table 14.2). They can be
grouped into two main types, granulocytes and agranulocytes. Granulocytes, include neutrophils,
eosinophils and basophils. They are formed in the red bone marrow (Fig. 14.20). Agranulocytes are
formed in lymphoid tissue, such as those of the lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, adenoids and the
thymus. Agranulocytes include monocytes and lymphocytes (B and T). Monocytes stay from 10- 20
hours in the blood, then enter tissues and become tissue macrophages, performing phagocytic
function (Fig. 14.24) Lymphocytes have life spans of months or even years; but this depends on the
body’s need for these cells.

Leucocytes protect the body against foreign invaders, and use circulatory system to travel to the
site of invasion. Monocytes and neutrophils travel through capillaries and reach the site of wound
where bacteria have gained entry. Macrophages and neutrophils feed on bacterial invaders or
other foreign cells, including cancer cells (Fig. 14.21). They typically die in the process, and their
dead bodies accumulate and contribute to the white substance called pus, seen at infection sites.
Basophils produce heparin - a substance that inhibits blood clotting. These also produce chemicals,
such as histamine, that participate in allergic reactions and in responses to tissue damage and
microbial invasion. Lymphocytes help to provide immunity against the disease.
(c) Platelets : These are not cells, but are fragments of large cells called megakaryoctyes (Fig.
14.22). There is no nucleus in them. There is no pigment in them. Platelets help in conversion of
ibrinogen, a soluble plasma protein, into insoluble form, ibrin. The ibrin threads enmash red
blood cells and other platelets in the area of damaged tissue, ultimately forming a blood clot. The
clot serves as a temporary seal to prevent bleeding until the damaged tissue can be repaired (Fig.
14.23).
Functions of blood
The overall functions of blood in humans can be listed as follows:
i) The plasma proteins maintain colloid osmotic pressure of the blood (75% by albumins, 25% by
 globulins and almost none by ibrinogen).
ii) Blood helps to transport materials, in the body including nutrients, water, salts and waste
 products. All hormones are transported by blood from the endocrine tissues to the target cells.
iii) Gases O2
 and CO2
 are transported by blood.
iv) Blood helps in body defenses against disease, neutrophils and monocytes engulf and destroy
 invading microorganisms e.g. bacteria.
v) Blood provides immunity by the lymphocytes (pages 325-327).
vi) Blood produces interferon, and antitoxins which are proteins, and protects our body from
 nucleic acids and toxins of invading organism.
44
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
vii) Blood acts as a bufer to maintain the acid - base balance i.e. concentration of H+
 and OH ions
 of the body.
viii) Helps in maintaining the body temperature, concentration of water and salts, thus helps in
 homeostosis.
ix) Wall of Blood helps in the exchange of materials between blood and body tissue through blood
 capillaries via interstitial luid.
x) Blood helps the body in maintaining the internal environment, by producing heparin, histamines,
 and also maintaining the amounts of chemicals including water and salts, in the body and
 maintains body temperature to a constant or nearly constant levels.
xi) Helps in blood clotting process and seals the wounds, that stop entry of pathogens into body.
DISORDERS
There are certain disorders, related to the blood. Some of them are discussed below:
i) Leucaemia (Blood Cancer)
It is the result of uncontrolled production of white blood cells (leucocytes). This is caused by a
cancerous mutation of a myelogenous or lymphogenous cell. The Leucaemia is usually characteriszed
by greatly increased numbers of abnormal white blood cells in the circulating blood. Myelogenous
cells (bone marrow cells) are in the bone marrow - and may spread throughout the body, so that
white blood cells are produced in many other organs. These white blood cells are not completely
diferentiated, and so are defective. Leucaemia may be of diferent types depending on the type
of white blood cells, which are undiferentiated and being produced at a faster, than normal rate.
There may be neutrophilic leucaemia, eosinophilic leucaemia, basophilic leucaemia, monocytic or
lymphocytic leucaemia. It is a very serious disorder and the patient needs to change the blood
regularly with the normal blood, got from donors. It can be cured by bone marrow transplant -
which is in most cases efective, but very expensive treatment.
ii) Thalassaemia (G. Thalassa = The sea; haema = blood)
It is also called Cooley’s anaemia on the name of Thomas B. Cooley, American pediatrician. It is a
45
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
genetically transmitted haemoglobin abnormality. It is characterized by the presence of microcytes,
by spleenomegaly (enlargement of spleen) and by changes in the bones and skin. The blood of
these patients is to be replaced regularly, with normal blood. It can be cured by bone marrow
transplant - which is very expensive - and does not give 100% cure rate. Haemoglobin molecule in
most cases, does not have (b- chains in it, instead F.chain is present (F is foetal haemoglobin).
iii) Oedema
It means the presence of excess luid in the tissues of the body. The excess luid may be in the
cells, or outside the cells. The intracellular oedema is caused by osmosis of water into the cells, and
cause, depression of metabolic systems (due to lack of nutrition and O2
 in the tissues) especially
and the Na-pump.
The extracellular oedema may be the result of :
i) Abnormal leakage of luid from the blood capillaries or failure of the lymphatic system to return
 luid from the interstitial luid.
ii) Oedma is caused by renal retention of salts and water. Oedema disturbs the exchange and
 concentration of minerals and ions in the blood and body cells, afects blood pressure, increases
 heart load etc.
(B) Pumping Organ - The Heart
Structure and action : The heart of humans is located in the chest cavity. The heart is enclosed in
a double membranous sac - the pericardial cavity, which contains the pericardial luid. Pericardium
protects the heart, prevents it from over extension.
The wall of the heart is composed of three layers.
(i) Epicardium (ii) Myocardium (iii) Endocardium
Myocardium of the heart is made up of special type of muscles, the cardiac muscles.
These muscles contain myoibrils, and myoilaments of myosin and actin. Their arrangement is
similar to those in skeletal muscle ibres, and their mechanism of contraction is essentially the
same, except that they are branched cells, in which the successive cells are separated by junctions
called intercalated discs. The heart contracts automatically with rhythmicity, under the control of
the autonomic nervous system of the body.
46
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
 Fig 14.24 The human heart and its valves and vessels.
There are four chambers of the heart: two upper thin-walled atria, and two lower thick walled
ventricles. Human heart functions as a double pump, and is responsible for pulmonary and systemic
circulation. Complete separation of deoxygenated blood (Right side) and oxygenated blood (left
side), in the heart, is maintained. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood via venae cavae
from the body.
The blood is passed on to right ventricle through tricuspid valve (called so because it has 3 laps).
These laps are attached with ibrous cords called chordeae tendinae, to the papillary muscles
which are extensions of the wall of the right ventricle. When right ventricle contracts, the blood is
47
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1

passed to pulmonary trunk, which carries blood via left and right pulmonary arteries, to the lungs.
At the base of the pulmonary trunk, semilunar valves are present. After oxygenation in lungs the
blood is brought by pulmonary veins to the left atrium, which passes this blood via bicuspid valve
(called so because it has two laps) to the left ventricle. The laps of bicuspid valve are similarly
attached through chordae tendinae, to papillary muscles of the wall of left ventricle. When the left
ventricle contracts, it pushes the blood through aorta to all parts of the body (except lungs). At the
base of aorta semilunar valves are also present. The valves of the heart control the direction of low
of blood. The wall of left ventricle is thicker (about 3 times) than that of the right ventricle. At the base
of aorta, irst pair of arteries,
the coronary arteries, arise,
and supply blood to the heart.
The aorta forms an arch, and
before descending down gives
three branches supplying
blood to head, arms and
shoulders. The aorta descends
down in the chest cavity. It
gives many small branches to
the chest wall and then passes
down to the abdominal region.
Here it gives branches, which
supply blood to diferent parts
of alimentary canal, kidneys
and the lower abdomen.
The aorta Bifurcates into iliac arteries, each of which leads to supply blood to each legs. The blood from
the upper part of the body is collected by diferent veins, which join to form superior vena cava; which
pass its blood to the right atrium. Two Iliac veins are formed by veins which collect blood from legs, and
unite to from inferior vena cava. It receives renal vein from each kidney; and hepatic vein from the
liver, before it enters the right atrium. The liver receives hepatic portal vein which is formed by many
veins collecting deoxygenated blood with absorbed food from diferent parts of alimentary canal.
The Cardiac Cycle
It is the sequence of events which take place during the completion of one heart beat. Heart beat
involves three distinct stages (Fig. 14.26).
Fig.14.25 The structure of cardiac muscle
48
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
1. Relaxation phase - diastole.
The deoxygenated blood enters right atrium through vena cava, and oxygenated blood enters left
atrium through pulmonary veins. The walls of the atria and that of ventricles are relaxed. As the
atria are illed with blood, they become distended and have more pressure than the ventricles. This
relaxed period of heart chambers is called diastole.
2. Atria Contract - atrial systole
The muscles of atria simultaneously contract, when the atria are illed and distended with blood,
this is called atrial systole. The blood passes through tricuspid and bicuspid valves, into the two
ventricles which are relaxed.
3. Ventricles contract - ventricular systole
When the ventricles receive blood from atria, both ventricles contract simultaneously and the blood
is pumped to pulmonary arteries and aorta. The tricuspid and bicuspid valves close, and ‘lubb’
sound is made. Ventricular systole ends, and ventricles relax at the same time semilunar valves
at the base of pulmonary artery and aorta close simultaneously, and ‘dubb’ sound is made. (Lubb,
dubb can be heard with the help of a stethoscope).
One complete heart beat consists of one systole and one diastole, and lasts for about 0.8 seconds.
In one’s life, heart contracts about 2.5 billion times, without stopping.
Fig.14.26 The cardiac cycle
49
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
Mechanism of heart Excitation and Contraction
The heart beat cycle described above starts when the sino-atrial node (Pace maker) at the upper end
of right atrium sends out electrical impulses to the atrial muscles, and causing both atria to contract.
The sino-atrial node consists of a small number of difusely oriented cardiac ibres, possessing few
myoibrils; and few nerve endings from
the autonomic nervous system.
Impulses from the node travel to the
musculature of the atrium and to
an atrioventricular node. From it an
atrioventricular bundle of muscle ibres
propagates the regulatory impulses
via excitable ibres in interventricular
septum, to themyocardium of
the ventricles. There is a delay
of approximately 0.15 second in
conductance from the S-A node to A-V
node, permitting atrial systole to be
completed before ventricular systole
begins (Fig. 14.28).

As the cardiac impulse passes through the heart, electrical currents spread into the tissues
surrounding the heart, and a small proportion of these spread all the way on the surface of the

body. If electrodes are placed on the skin on opposite sides of the heart, electrical potentials
generated by these currents can be recorded. This recording is known as electro cardiogram which
is taken by electrocardiograph (E.C.G.) machine. It helps to diagonose the abnormalities in the
rhythmicity and conduction system of the heart which may be corrected by the use of artiicial
pacemaker.
Artiicial pace maker
Pacemaker is responsible for initiating the impulses which trigger the heart beat rate. If there
is some block in the low of the electrical impulses, or if the impulses initiated by S.A. node are
weak; it may lead to death of the individual. So an artiicial pacemaker, which is battery operated
producing electrical stimulus is used. For example if A-V pathway is blocked, the electrodes of
artiicial pacemaker are attached to the ventricle. Then this pacemaker provides continued rhythmic
impulses that take over the control of the ventricles.

Blue babies
Failure of interatrial foramen (an opening in the inter-atrial septum) to close or of ductus arteriosus
to fully constrict results in cyanosis (blueness of skin) of new bom. This is due to mixing of blood
between two atria and the mixed blood is supplied to the body of newborn babies resulting in
blueness of skin, thus the name blue babies.
(C) Blood vessels
The third component of the blood circulatory system of humans comprises of the blood vessels;
arteries, capillaries and veins.
(i) Arteries : These are blood vessels which carry blood away from the heart to diferent parts
of the body. The wall of the arteries is made up of three layers, outer, (made of connective tissue
and elastic ibres), middle (made of thick muscular tissue and elastic ibres) and inner, endothelium
(Table 14-3, and Fig 14.30).
The contraction of the circular (smooth muscles) of arteries and arterioles is under the control of
nervous and endocrine systems. When stimulated the muscle contracts, constricting the arterioles
(vasoconstriction) and thus reducing the low of blood in them.
When the muscles are relaxed the arterioles are dilated (vasodilation) more blood lows in them,
The arterioles themselves divide repeatedly until they form a dense network of microscopic vessels,
called capillaries.
Atherosclerosis (G. athere = porridge; skeleoris = hardening): It is coexisting atheroma and
arteriosclerosis; atheroma is deposition of hard yellow plaque of lipoid material in the inner most
layer of the arteries, which may be due to high level of cholesterol in the blood.Arteriosclerosis
is a degenerative arterial change associated with advancing age. Primarily a thickening of middle
layer of arteries, and usually associated with some degree of atheroma. So Atherosclerosis causes
narrowing and hardening of arteries. This increases the risk of formation of thrombus (see thrombus
formation), and if thrombus is formed in the brain or heart it is fatal. (Atherosclerosis is a major
condition leading to heart attack.
(ii) Capillaries : These are blood vessels with walls that are only one cell thick (Table 4.3, Fig. 14.29,
14.30). Although the blood appears conined within the capillary walls, the latter are permeable with
the result, that water and dissolved substances pass in and out exchanging oxygen, carbon dioxide
dissolved food and excretory products with the tissues around capillary. The capillary network is
52
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
so dense that no living cell is far from a supply of oxygen and food. In the liver, every cell is in
direct contact with a capillary. The diameter of a capillary can be altered by nervous stimulation,
which tends to close them, and by chemicals, such as histamine, which dilate them. The change in
diameter is brought about by a change in the shape of the cells, constituting their walls. The pre
capillary sphincters also regulate the amount of blood lowing in capillaries. Thus the amount of
blood lowing in a certain tissue is controlled.
The capillaries are the sites where the materials are exchanged between the blood and body tissues.
This exchange occurs in three ways.
(i) Active transport and difusion through the cells lining the capillary wall into the interstitial or
 extracellular luid, and then to the body cells, and vice versa.
(ii) Through the intercellular spaces of endothelial lining of wall of capillary to and from the
 extracellular luid.
(iii) Materials from the cavity of capillaries are also taken up by endocytosis, and then passed to
 the other side by exocytosis. Same is true for some materials entering from the interceullar
 spaces (extracellular luid) into the blood.
Thus the exchange of materials takes place between blood and tissues via extracellular or interstitial
luid. Capillaries join to form venules, which join to form veins.
(iii) Veins : These blood vessels transport blood from body cells towards heart. The wall of veins
has same three layers as are present in arteries. But middle layer is relatively thin and only slightly
muscular, with few elastic ibres, (table 14.3 and Fig. 14.30). The semilunar valves are present in the
veins. These valves prevent the back low of blood, as it is moving towards the heart. The pressure
of surrounding muscles, when they contract, tends to squash the veins and assist the return of
blood towards heart.
Veins join to form larger veins, and ultimately form venae cavae (Inferior vena cava and superior
vena cava) which pour the blood into the right atrium of the heart. The oxygenated blood from the
lungs is brought to the left atrium by pulmonary veins.
53
14. Transport eLearn.Punjab
V: 1.1
 Fig.14.29 The exchange of gases and nutrients in a capillary.
The pressure within capillaries causes a continuous leakage of luid from the blood plasma into
the spaces that surround the capillaries and tissues. This luid, known as interstitial luid consists
primarily of water, in which the dissolved nutrients, hormones gases, wastes, and small proteins
from the blood are present. Large proteins red blood cells and platelets cannot cross the intercellular
spaces of capillary wall, so they remain within capillaries. But some white blood cells can squeeze
out through the intercellular spaces of capillary wall. Interstitial luid is the medium through which
the exchange of materials between the blood and nearby cell occurs. (Fig. 14.29)

Blood Pressure and Rate of low of Blood
It is the measure of force with which blood pushes up against the walls of blood vessels. It is
the force that keeps blood lowing from the heart to all the capillary networks in the body. This
pressure is generated by the contraction of ventricles (ventricle systole) and is the highest in aorta,
then gradually reduces in arteries. The walls of arteries are elastic and the low of blood stretches
them, and it is felt as pulse. During diastole, the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the heart is
not exerting pressure on the blood in the arteries and pressure in them falls. The pressure reaches
56

V: 1.1
its high point during systole (systolic pressure which in normal individuals is 120 mm Hg) and its
low point during diastole (diastolic pressure which in normal individuals ranges between 75-85
mm Hg). The blood pressure gradually declines (Fig. 14.31). The decline of the blood pressure in
successive parts of systemic circuit, is the result of friction between the lowing blood and the walls
of the blood vessels - thus blood moves from a region of higher pressure towards a region of lower
pressure.
Several other changes occur along the route of blood low.
i) The diference between systolic and diastolic pressure continues to diminish until it disappears
in the capillaries and veins.
ii) The rate of blood low tends to fall as the blood moves through the branching arteries and
arterioles, the rate is lowest in the capillaries; and increases again in the venules and veins. These
changes in rate of blood low result from changes in the total cross sectional area of the vessel
system. The low of blood in veins is maintained by the contraction of surrounding muscles and the
action of semilunar valves which prevent back low of blood. Muscular activity including breathing
movements help normal low of blood in the body.

Hypertension
It is a condition of high blood pressure. Prolonged high blood pressure damages the lining of the
blood vessels and also leads to weakening of heart muscles (which have become thickened due
to the continuous strain imposed on them), with declining eiciency of the pumping action of the
heart. Blood may then be retained in the heart and lungs, often leading to fatal condition called
congestive heart failure.
Thrombus Formation and Hypertension
Thrombus is a solid mass or plug of blood constituents
(clot) in a blood vessel. This mass may block (wholly
or only in part) the vessels in which it forms, or it may
be dislodged and carried to some other location in
the circulatory system, in which case it is called an
embolus. Thrombosis is the formation of thrombus
(Fig. 14.32). Thromboembolism is leading cause of
deaths in western civilization.

mass) has blocked blood low near a point where the vessel branches.
The blood has pulled away from the left end of the thrombus and is
beginning to pull away from the right end also.

Thrombus formation may be due the following:
i) Irritation or infection of lining of blood vessels.
ii) Reduced rate of blood low, due to long periods
 of inactivity.
iii) Pneumonia and tuberculosis, emphysema
Heart attack (Myocardial infarction)
Blockage of blood vessel in the heart by an embolus (or by locally formed thrombus) causes necrosis
or damage to portion of heart muscles, a condition known as a heart attack or technically myocardial
infarction, Heart attack is due to disruptions of control system of the heart with accompanying
arrhythmias, especially ventricular ibrillation.
We can avoid the above mentioned situations if we :
i) Avoid too much fatty food (especially rich in cholesterol). Maintain normal body weight.
ii) Control blood pressure by regular walk and exercise.
iii) Do not smoke.
Stroke
If the normal low of blood is blocked by an embolus (or a locally formed thrombus), in a blood
vessel in the brain, and causes necrosis, or death, of the surrounding neural tissue (owing to lack
of O2
), the condition is called a stroke or cerebral infarction. The symptoms of the stroke vary
depending on the part of the brain that has been damaged.
Haemorrhage
It is the discharge of blood from blood vessels. Especially important is the brain haemorrhage which
results from bursting of any of the arteries supplying the brain. When the wall of the arteries becomes
hard and loses its elasticity - and higher blood pressures would result in brain haemorrhage. To
avoid brain haemorrhage, the blood pressure must be controlled between normal limits.
In almost all the above mentioned problems, it is important to take following preventive measures :
• Taking in of less cholesterol in our food. Maintenance of normal blood pressure.
• Do not become over weight.
• Do not smoke.
• Do regular exercise.
• Avoid stress and tension.

LYMPHATIC SYSTEM
This system is responsible for the transport and returning of materials from the tissues of the body
to the blood.
The system comprises lymph capillaries, lymph vessels, lymphoid masses, lymph nodes, and lymphthe luid which lows in the system.
Lymph capillaries end blindly in the body tissues, where pressure from the accumulation of
interstitial luid or extracellular luid forces the luid into the lymph capillaries. When this luid
enters the lymph capillaries, it is called lymph. The lymph vessels empty in veins; so lymph is a luid
in transit between interstitial luid and the blood.
The intercellular spaces in the walls of lymph vessels are larger than those of the capillaries of blood
vascular system. So larger molecules, from the interstitial luid can also enter the lymph capillaries.
Lymph capillaries join to form larger and larger lymph vessels; and ultimately form thoracic lymph
duct, which opens into subclavian vein. The low of lymph is always towards the thoracic duct.
In the intestine, the branches of lymph capillaries, within villi, are called lacteals.
The low of lymph is maintained by :
Activity of skeletal muscles, movement of viscera, breathing movements and the valves, which
prevent back low of lymph.
Along the pathway, the lymph vessels have, at certain points, masses of connective tissue where
lymphocytes are present; these are lymph nodes. Several aferent lymph vessels enter a lymph
node, which is drained by a single, eferent lymph vessels.
Lymph nodes are present in the neck region, axilla and groin of humans.
In addition, several lymphoid masses are present in the walls of digestive tract, in the mucosa and
submucosa. The larger masses spleen and thymus, tonsils and adenoids are all lymphoid masses.
These produce lymphocytes.

There are the several functions performed by lymphatic system.
i) In an average person, about three litres more luid leaves the blood capillaries than is
 reabsorbed by them each day. It returns this excess luid and its dissolved proteins and other
 substances to the blood.
ii) The lacteals of villi absorb large fat globules, which are released by interstitial cells after the
 products of digestion of fats are absorbed. After a fatty meal these fat globules may make
 up 1% of the lymph.
iii) The lymphatic system helps defend the body against foreign invaders. Lymph nodes have
 lymphocytes and macrophages that destroy bacteria and viruses. The painful swelling of
 lymph nodes in certain diseases (mumps is an extreme example) is largely a result of the
 accumulation of dead lymphocytes and macrophages.
iv ) Just as the lymph nodes ilter lymph, the spleen ilters blood, exposing it to macrophages and
 lymphoctyes that destroy foreign particles and aged red blood cells.
IMMUNITY - AND ITS TYPES
Immunity
The capacity to recognize the intrusion of any material foreign to the body and to mobilize cells
and cell products to help remove the particular sort of foreign material with greater speed and
efectiveness” is called immunity.
In animals in addition to physical barriers (skin + mucous membranes) and phagocytes, there is a
third mechanism, to defend their bodies against the foreign
invaders; this is the immune system.
The components of immune system include the lymphocytes
(B and T) and the antibodies - which are special type of proteins.
These antibodies are immunoglobulins which are synthesized
by vertebrates, in response to antigens; and immobilise it, or
sets in motion events that ultimately cause its destruction.
Lymphocyte T and B have been named due
to their relationship with Thymus gland, and
Bursa of Fabricius respectively. The inluence
of the thymus gland essential in making
T-cells immunologically competent.Bursa of
Fabricius is lymphoid structure present in
the wall ofcloaca of young birds from where
B-lymphoctyes were discovered to have role
in immune system.

Antigen or immunogen is a foreign substance, often a protein which stimulates the formation
of antibodies (Fig. 14.34) Antibodies are speciic i.e. cause the destruction of the antigen, which
stimulated their production. Antibodies are manufactured in B-lymphocytes , then
secreted in to the lymph and blood where they circulate freely.
Fig. 14.34 (a) An antibody molecule consists of four polypeptide chains - two identical light chain and two identical heavychains - linked
by disulide (- S - S -) bridges. Variable amino acid sequences (V) in the light chains and upper regions of the heavy chains determine
which antigen will bind to that particular antibody. Constant amino acid sequences (C) are the same for all the antibodies in one class
(b) Large antigen-antibody complexes will form if there are multiple copies of the antigenic molecule on the foreign cell’s surface.
T-cells recognize antigen, then combat micro-organisms and / or efect the rejection of foreign
tissues (in case of tissue transplant). This is called cell-mediated response.
B-cells recognize antigen and form plasma cell clone. These plasma cells synthesise and liberate
antibodies into the blood plasma and tissue luid. Here antibodies attach to the surfaces of bacteria
and speed up their phagocytosis, or combine with and neutralise toxins produced by microorganisms, by producing antitoxins. This is called humoral Immune response.
When we get vaccination, against a speciic disease (antigen), we become immune to that infection
or disease. If we get vaccination against, polio, smallpox, measles, mumps etc., once in our life time,
we are protected or become immune to that infection in our future life.

Types of immunity
Active Immunity : The use of vaccines, which stimulate the production of antibodies in the body,
and making a person immune against the disease or infection, is called active immunity. But this
active immunity has been achieved by artiicially introducing, antigens in the body, so it is called
artiicially induced active immunity.
But, when a person is exposed to an infection (antigen) - becomes ill, and in
most cases survives then this immunity, developed against that disease is called
naturally induced immunity or auto immune response.
Passive immunity : In contrast to active immunity, in which case antigens are introduced to
stimulate the production of antibodies, by artiicial or natural method; antibodies are injected in
the form of antisera, to make a person immune against a disease,This is called passive immunity.
In body, antigen - antibody complexes are formed which are taken up by phagocytes and destroyed.
The patient is spared the complications (or possibly death) caused by the infection or venom.
Passive immunity response is immediate, but not long lasting. Because no time is taken for the
production of suicient level of antibodies, (as antibodies are being injected) and after the level of
antibodies is reduced or they are used up - No more antibodies production is there.
The method of passive immunization
is used to combat active infections of,
tetanus, infectious hepatitis, rabies, snake
bite venom etc. In the case of snake bite
venom passive immunity is produced by the
antitoxins so the serum is called antivenom
serum.


AIDS (Acquired Immune Deiciency Syndrome;
is a disease caused by a virus. The afected persons sufer from
deiciency in their immun system of the body, and the immune system
collapses. Thus the AIDS victim often succumb to a bacterial disease
or cancer, that under normal circumstances, the immune system can
over come. There is no known cure of the disease. It can spread by
blood transfusion and by sexual contact with the infected persons.
Antiserum is a
serum containing
antibodies.
